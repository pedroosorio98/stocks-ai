Firmwide overview JPMorgan Chase reported strong results in the second quarter of 2019, with record net income of $9.7 billion, or $2.82 per share, on net revenue of $28.8 billion. The Firm reported ROE of 16% and ROTCE of 20%. • The Firm had record net income of $9.7 billion, up 16%, which reflects income tax benefits of $768 million related to the resolution of certain tax audits, higher net revenue and lower credit costs, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense. • Total net revenue increased 4%. Net interest income was $14.4 billion, up 7%, driven by balance sheet growth and mix, as well as the impact of higher rates. Noninterest revenue was $14.4 billion, up 1%, driven by several notable items, including: – a gain from the IPO of a strategic investment in Tradeweb, and – the impact of the prior-year adjustment of approximately $330 million to the credit card rewards liability predominantly offset by – MSR adjustments reflecting updates to model inputs, and – net valuation losses on certain legacy private equity investments compared with net gains in the prior year. Excluding these items, noninterest revenue was relatively flat, with strength in CCB, offset by lower investment banking fees in the CIB and CB, as well as lower Markets noninterest revenue. • Noninterest expense was $16.3 billion, up 2%, driven by continued investments in the business and higher auto lease depreciation, partially offset by lower FDIC charges. • The provision for credit losses was $1.1 billion, down 5%. • The total allowance for credit losses was $14.3 billion at June 30, 2019, and the Firm had a loan loss coverage ratio of 1.39%, compared with 1.41% in the prior year; excluding the PCI portfolio, the equivalent ratio was 1.28%, compared with 1.22% in the prior year. The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $5.3 billion at June 30, 2019, a decrease from $5.8 billion in the prior year, reflecting improved credit performance in the consumer portfolio. • Firmwide average total loans were $954.9 billion, up 2%. Selected capital-related metrics • The Firm’s CET1 capital was $189 billion, and the Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 12.2% and 13.1%, respectively. • The Firm’s supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) was 6.4% at June 30, 2019. • The Firm continued to grow tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), ending the second quarter of 2019 at $59.52, up 8%. ROTCE and TBVPS are non-GAAP financial measures. For a further discussion of each of these measures, refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non- GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Measures on pages 19–20. 7 Business segment highlights Selected business metrics for each of the Firm’s four lines of business are presented below for the second quarter of 2019. CCB ROE 31% • Average loans down 2%; Home Lending loans down 7% impacted by loan sales; credit card loans up 8% • Client investment assets up 16%; average deposits up 3% • Credit card sales volume up 11% and merchant processing volume up 12% CIB ROE 14% • Maintained #1 ranking for Global Investment Banking fees with 9.2% wallet share YTD • Total Markets revenue of $5.4 billion was flat, or down 6% adjusted(a) CB ROE 17% • Gross Investment Banking revenue of $592 million • Strong credit performance with net charge-offs of 3 bps AWM ROE 27% • Average loan balances up 7% • Assets under management (AUM) of $2.2 trillion, up 7% (a) Adjusted Markets revenue excludes a gain from the IPO of a strategic investment in Tradeweb. For a detailed discussion of results by business segment, refer to the Business Segment Results on pages 21–42. Credit provided and capital raised JPMorgan Chase continues to support consumers, businesses and communities around the globe. The Firm provided new and renewed credit and raised capital for wholesale and consumer clients during the first six months of 2019, consisting of: $1.1 trillion Total credit provided and capital raised $119 billion Credit for consumers $14 billion Credit for U.S. small businesses $435 billion Credit for corporations $547 billion Capital raised for corporate clients and non-U.S. government entities $34 billion Credit and capital raised for nonprofit and U.S. government entities(a) (a) Includes states, municipalities, hospitals and universities. 8 Recent events On July 24, 2019, JPMorgan Chase acquired InstaMed, a leading U.S. healthcare technology company that specializes in healthcare payments. On July 10, 2019, JPMorgan Chase announced the launch of You Invest Portfolios, a new digital investing solution. On June 27, 2019, the Federal Reserve informed the Firm that it did not object to the Firm’s 2019 capital plan, submitted under the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”). As a result, the Firm announced that the Board of Directors intends to increase the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.90 per share (up from the current $0.80 per share), effective the third quarter of 2019 and has authorized gross common equity repurchases of up to $29.4 billion between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020 under a new common equity repurchase program. On June 26, 2019, JPMorgan Chase announced that it will expand the Firm’s investment in Detroit’s economic recovery, committing to reach $200 million by the end of 2022. The announcement comes as the Firm exceeded its initial five year $150 million commitment. On May 18, 2019, Chase Bank USA, National Association (“Chase Bank USA, N.A.”), a national bank which was the Firm’s principal credit card-issuing bank, merged with and into JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as the surviving bank. 2019 outlook These current expectations are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. For a further discussion of certain of those risks and uncertainties and the other factors that could cause JPMorgan Chase’s actual results to differ materially because of those risks and uncertainties, refer to Forward-Looking Statements on page 79 of this Form 10-Q and Risk Factors on pages 7–28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Annual Report. There is no assurance that actual results in the full year of 2019 will be in line with the outlook set forth below, and the Firm does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. JPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for the remainder of 2019 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment, client and customer activity levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business. Each of these factors will affect the performance of the Firm and its lines of business. The Firm expects that it will continue to make appropriate adjustments to its businesses and operations in response to ongoing developments in the legal, regulatory, business and economic environments in which it operates. Firmwide • Management expects full-year 2019 net interest income, on a managed basis, to be $57.5 billion +/-, market dependent. This range reflects lower long-end rates and up to three federal funds rate cuts of 25bps each in July, September, and December 2019 by the Federal Reserve. • The Firm takes a disciplined approach to managing its expenses, while investing for growth and innovation. As a result, management expects Firmwide adjusted expense for the full-year 2019 to be less than $66 billion. • The Firm continues to experience charge-off rates at very low levels as credit trends across the consumer and wholesale portfolios remain favorable. Management expects full-year 2019 net charge-offs to be approximately $5.5 billion. 9 Business Developments Expected departure of the U.K. from the EU The U.K.’s expected departure from the EU, which is commonly referred to as “Brexit,” is scheduled to occur not later than October 31, 2019. The Firm continues to execute the relevant elements of its Firmwide Brexit Implementation program with the objective of delivering the Firm’s capabilities to its EU clients on “day one” of any departure by the U.K. from the EU, whether or not an agreement has been reached to allow an orderly withdrawal. The principal operational risks associated with Brexit continue to be the potential for disruption caused by insufficient preparations by individual market participants or in the overall market ecosystem, and risks related to potential disruptions of connectivity among market participants. Although legislative and regulatory actions taken by the EU and the U.K. have mitigated some of the significant market-wide risks, there continues to be regulatory and legal uncertainty with respect to various matters including contract continuity and access by market participants to liquidity in certain products, such as products subject to potentially conflicting U.K. and EU regulatory requirements in relation to eligible trading venues, including certain cross-border derivative contracts and equities that are listed on both U.K. and EU exchanges. As discussed in Business Developments on page 46 of the 2018 Form 10-K, the Firm is focused on the following key areas to ensure continuation of service to its EU clients: regulatory and legal entity readiness; client readiness; and business and operational readiness. Following are the significant updates from the matters discussed in the 2018 Form 10-K. Regulatory and legal entity readiness The Firm’s legal entities in Germany, Luxembourg and Ireland are now prepared and licensed to provide services to the Firm’s EU clients, including after any departure by the U.K. from the EU. Client readiness The agreements covering a significant proportion of the Firm’s EU client activity have been re-documented to other EU legal entities to help facilitate continuation of service. The Firm continues to actively engage with clients that have not completed re-documentation to ensure preparedness both in terms of documentation and any operational changes that may be required. The Firm may be negatively impacted by any operational disruption stemming from delays of or lapses in the readiness of other market participants or market infrastructures. Business and operational readiness The Firm relocated certain employees during the first quarter of 2019. During the second quarter of 2019, the Firm has added specific employees to certain EU legal entities, where appropriate, to support the level of client activity that has been migrated. However, the Firm’s final staffing plan will depend upon the timing and terms of any withdrawal by the U.K. from the EU. If Brexit is further delayed due to a transition deal or another mechanism, the Firm will continue to review the timing and extent of any further expansion of activities in its EU legal entities, as appropriate. The Firm continues to closely monitor legislative developments, and its implementation plan allows for flexibility given the continued uncertainties. LIBOR transition The Firm continues to develop and implement plans to appropriately mitigate the risks associated with the expected discontinuation of certain unsecured benchmark interest rates, including the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other Interbank Offered Rates (“IBORs”). In particular, the Firm: • has implemented or is in the process of implementing fallback language for LIBOR-linked syndicated loans, securitizations, floating rate notes and bi-lateral business loans based on the recommendations of the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, and has started to introduce the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as a replacement benchmark rate for certain of these products; • continues to monitor the transition relief being considered by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) concerning the accounting for contract modifications and hedge accounting; and • continues to engage with regulators and clients as the transition from IBORs progresses. Refer to Business Developments on page 47 of the 2018 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s initiatives to address the expected discontinuation of LIBOR and other IBORs. 10 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This section provides a comparative discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated Results of Operations on a reported basis for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, unless otherwise specified. Factors that relate primarily to a single business segment are discussed in more detail within that business segment. For a discussion of the Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm that affect the Consolidated Results of Operations, refer to pages 76–77 of this Form 10-Q and pages 141-143 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Revenue Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, (in millions) 2019 2018 Change 2019 2018 Change Investment banking fees $ 1,851 $ 2,168 (15)% $ 3,691 $ 3,904 (5)% Principal transactions 3,714 3,782 (2) 7,790 7,734 1 Lending- and deposit-related fees 1,535 1,495 3 3,017 2,972 2 Asset management, administration and commissions 4,353 4,304 1 8,467 8,613 (2) Investment securities gains/(losses) 44 (80) NM 57 (325) NM Mortgage fees and related income 279 324 (14) 675 789 (14) Card income 1,366 1,020 34 2,640 2,295 15 Other income(a) 1,292 1,255 3 2,767 2,881 (4) Noninterest revenue 14,434 14,268 1 29,104 28,863 1 Net interest income 14,398 13,485 7 28,851 26,797 8 Total net revenue $ 28,832 $ 27,753 4% $ 57,955 $ 55,660 4% (a) Included operating lease income of $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively and $2.6 billion and $2.2 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Quarterly results Investment banking fees decreased reflecting lower fees across products driven by declines in industry-wide fee levels, and when compared with a strong prior year. For additional information, refer to CIB segment results on pages 27–32 and Note 5. Principal transactions revenue includes a gain in CIB from the IPO of a strategic investment in Tradeweb. Excluding this gain, principal transactions revenue decreased, reflecting: • lower revenue in CIB primarily driven by derivatives in Equity Markets, largely offset by higher client activity in agency mortgage trading in Fixed Income Markets • net valuation losses on certain legacy private equity investments in Corporate compared with net gains in the prior year • losses on cash deployment transactions in Treasury and Chief Investment Office (“CIO”), which were more than offset by the related net interest income earned on those transactions • lower revenue related to hedges on certain investments in AWM, which was more than offset by higher valuation gains on the related investments reflected in other income. For additional information, refer to CIB, AWM and Corporate segment results on pages 27–32, pages 37–40 and pages 41–42, and Note 5. Asset management, administration and commissions revenue increased primarily reflecting higher asset management fees in CBB from growth in client investment assets. For additional information, refer to CCB, AWM and CIB segment results on pages 22–26 , pages 37–40 and pages 27–32, respectively, and Note 5. Lending- and deposit-related fees increased primarily reflecting higher deposit-related fees in CCB. For additional information, refer to CCB segment results on pages 22–26, CIB on pages 27–32 and CB on pages 33–36, respectively, and Note 5. Investment securities gains/(losses) primarily reflect the impact of repositioning the investment securities portfolio. For additional information, refer to Corporate segment results on pages 41–42 and Note 9. 11 Mortgage fees and related income decreased driven by: • lower net mortgage servicing revenue on lower MSR risk management results reflecting updates to model inputs, and lower operating revenue reflecting faster prepayment speeds on lower rates predominantly offset by • higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting higher mortgage production margins and volumes, as well as the impact of loan sales in Home Lending. For further information, refer to CCB segment results on pages 22–26, Note 5 and 14. Card income increased reflecting the impact of the prior- year adjustment of approximately $330 million to the credit card rewards liability. For further information, refer to CCB segment results on pages 22–26 and Note 5. Other income increased reflecting: • higher operating lease income from growth in auto operating lease volume in CCB, and • higher investment valuation gains in AWM, which were largely offset by the impact of the related hedges reflected in principal transactions revenue partially offset by • lower other income in CIB associated with the increased amortization on a higher level of alternative energy investments. The lower income tax expense from the associated tax credits more than offset the impact of the higher amortization. For further information, refer to Note 5. Net interest income increased driven by the impact of balance sheet growth and change in mix, as well as higher rates, partially offset by lower CIB Markets net interest income. The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $2.3 trillion, up $133 billion, and the net interest yield on these assets, on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis, was 2.49%, an increase of 1 basis point. The net interest yield excluding CIB Markets was 3.35%, an increase of 14 basis points. Net interest yield excluding CIB markets is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a further discussion of this measure, refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Measures on pages 19–20. Year-to-date results Investment banking fees decreased reflecting lower equity underwriting and advisory fees driven by declines in industry-wide fee levels. Principal transactions revenue includes a gain in CIB from the IPO of a strategic investment in Tradeweb. Excluding this gain, CIB’s revenue was relatively flat, reflecting: • favorable changes in funding spreads on derivatives in Credit Adjustments & Other, and higher revenue in agency mortgage trading in Fixed Income Markets offset by – lower client activity in derivatives in Equity Markets, and lower revenue in Currencies & Emerging Markets within Fixed Income Markets the net increase in CIB was offset by • losses on cash deployment transactions in Treasury and CIO, which were more than offset by the related net interest income earned on those transactions • lower revenue related to hedges on certain investments in AWM, which was more than offset by higher valuation gains on the related investments reflected in other income. Asset management, administration and commissions revenue decreased reflecting: • lower asset management fees in AWM driven by a shift in the mix toward lower fee products and lower average market levels, and • lower brokerage commissions in CIB on lower activity partially offset by • higher asset management fees in CBB from growth in client investment assets. For information on lending- and deposit-related fees, refer to CCB on pages 22–26, CIB on pages 27–32 and CB on pages 33–36, respectively, and Note 5. Investment securities gains/(losses) primarily reflect the impact of repositioning the investment securities portfolio. 12 Mortgage fees and related income decreased driven by: • lower net mortgage servicing revenue on lower MSR risk management results reflecting updates to model inputs, and lower operating revenue reflecting lower servicing revenue on a lower level of third-party loans serviced and faster prepayment speeds on lower rates predominantly offset by • higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting higher mortgage production margins and volumes, as well as the impact of loan sales in Home Lending. Card income increased reflecting the impact of the prior- year adjustment of approximately $330 million to the credit card rewards liability. Other income decreased reflecting: • lower other income in CIB associated with the increased amortization on a higher level of alternative energy investments. The lower income tax expense from the associated tax credits more than offset the impact of the higher amortization partially offset by • higher operating lease income from growth in auto operating lease volume in CCB, and • higher investment valuation gains in AWM, which were largely offset by the impact of the related hedges reflected in principal transactions revenue. The prior year included $505 million of fair value gains related to the adoption of the recognition and measurement accounting guidance for certain equity investments previously held at cost in the first quarter of 2018. Net interest income increased driven by the impact of balance sheet growth and change in mix, as well as higher rates, partially offset by lower CIB Markets net interest income. The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $2.3 trillion, up $122 billion, and the net interest yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, was 2.53%, an increase of 4 basis points. The net interest yield excluding CIB Markets was 3.39%, an increase of 22 basis points. Net interest yield excluding CIB markets is a non-GAAP financial measure. Provision for credit losses Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, (in millions) 2019 2018 Change 2019 2018 Change Consumer, excluding credit card $ (318) $ (56) (468)% $ (204) $ 90 NM Credit card 1,440 1,164 24 2,642 2,334 13 Total consumer 1,122 1,108 1 2,438 2,424 1 Wholesale 27 102 (74) 206 (49) NM Total provision for credit losses $ 1,149 $ 1,210 (5)% $ 2,644 $ 2,375 11% Quarterly results The provision for credit losses decreased driven by wholesale, with the prior year reflecting a higher provision from net portfolio activity, including new exposures and loan sales. The total consumer provision was relatively flat reflecting: • an increase in credit card due to – a $200 million addition to the allowance for loan losses reflecting loan growth and higher loss rates, as anticipated, and – higher net charge-offs on loan growth offset by • a decrease in consumer, excluding credit card due to – a $400 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses in the PCI residential real estate portfolio, reflecting continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies partially offset by – higher net charge-offs in the residential real estate portfolio as the prior year benefited from a recovery on a loan sale. For additional information on the credit portfolio and the allowance for credit losses, refer to the segments discussions of CCB on pages 22–26, CIB on pages 27–32, CB on pages 33–36, the Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 67–68, and Note 12. 13 Year-to-date results The provision for credit losses increased predominantly driven by wholesale, reflecting a net addition to the allowance for credit losses on select Commercial and Industrial (“C&I”) client downgrades. The prior period was a benefit, reflecting a reduction in the allowance for credit losses primarily driven by a single name in the Oil & Gas portfolio, partially offset by other net portfolio activity. The total consumer provision was relatively flat reflecting: • an increase in credit card due to – a $200 million addition to the allowance for loan losses reflecting loan growth and higher loss rates, as anticipated, and – higher net charge-offs on loan growth offset by • a decrease in consumer, excluding credit card due to – a $400 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses in the PCI residential real estate portfolio, reflecting continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies partially offset by – higher net charge-offs in the residential real estate portfolio as the prior year benefited from a recovery from a loan sale. Noninterest expense Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, (in millions) 2019 2018 Change 2019 2018 Change Compensation expense $ 8,547 $ 8,338 3% $ 17,484 $ 17,200 2% Noncompensation expense: Occupancy 1,060 981 8 2,128 1,869 14 Technology, communications and equipment 2,378 2,168 10 4,742 4,222 12 Professional and outside services 2,212 2,126 4 4,251 4,247 — Marketing 862 798 8 1,741 1,598 9 Other expense(a)(b) 1,282 1,560 (18) 2,390 2,915 (18) Total noncompensation expense 7,794 7,633 2 15,252 14,851 3 Total noninterest expense $ 16,341 $ 15,971 2% $ 32,736 $ 32,051 2% (a) Included Firmwide legal expense/(benefit) of $69 million and $0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively and $(12) million and $70 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. (b) Included FDIC-related expense of $121 million and $368 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively and $264 million and $751 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Quarterly results Compensation expense increased driven by investments in the businesses, including front office hires, as well as technology staff, largely offset by lower performance- related compensation in CIB. Noncompensation expense increased as a result of: • higher investments in the businesses, including, technology, real estate and marketing • higher depreciation expense from growth in auto operating lease volume in CCB • higher outside services expense primarily due to higher volume-related brokerage expense in certain businesses in CIB • higher legal expense, and • a contribution to the Firm’s Foundation, whereas all prior- year contributions were made in the fourth quarter largely offset by • lower FDIC charges as a result of the elimination of the surcharge at the end of the third quarter of 2018, and • the absence of a loss in the prior year on the liquidation of a legal entity of $174 million For additional information on the liquidation of a legal entity, refer to Note 19. Year-to-date results Compensation expense increased driven by investments in the businesses, including front office hires, as well as technology staff, largely offset by lower performance- related compensation in CIB. Noncompensation expense increased as a result of: • higher investments in the businesses, including, technology, real estate and marketing • higher depreciation expense from growth in auto operating lease volume in CCB, and • contributions to the Firm’s Foundation, whereas all prior- year contributions were made in the fourth quarter largely offset by • lower FDIC charges as a result of the elimination of the surcharge at the end of the third quarter of 2018, and • the absence of a loss of $174 million in the prior year in other expense on the liquidation of a legal entity in Corporate. 14 Income tax expense Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, (in millions) 2019 2018 Change 2019 2018 Change Income before income tax expense $ 11,342 $10,572 7% $ 22,575 $ 21,234 6% Income tax expense 1,690 2,256 (25) 3,744 4,206 (11) Effective tax rate 14.9% 21.3% 16.6% 19.8% Quarterly results The effective tax rate decreased due to the recognition of $768 million of tax benefits related to the resolution of certain tax audits and the change in the mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes. The decrease was partially offset by a $189 million tax benefit recorded in the second quarter of 2018 resulting from a change in the estimate for the deemed repatriation tax on non-U.S. earnings. For additional information on the 2019 tax benefits, refer to Note 1. Year-to-date results The effective tax rate decreased due to the recognition of $874 million of tax benefits related to the resolution of certain tax audits and the change in the mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes. The decrease was partially offset by a decrease in tax benefits related to the vesting of employee stock-based awards, as well as a $189 million tax benefit recorded in the second quarter of 2018 resulting from a change in the estimate for the deemed repatriation tax on non-U.S. earnings. 15 CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND CASH FLOWS ANALYSIS Consolidated balance sheets analysis The following is a discussion of the significant changes between June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018. Selected Consolidated balance sheets data (in millions) June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Change Assets Cash and due from banks $ 23,164 $ 22,324 4% Deposits with banks 244,874 256,469 (5) Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements 267,864 321,588 (17) Securities borrowed 130,661 111,995 17 Trading assets 523,373 413,714 27 Investment securities 307,264 261,828 17 Loans 956,889 984,554 (3) Allowance for loan losses (13,166) (13,445) (2) Loans, net of allowance for loan losses 943,723 971,109 (3) Accrued interest and accounts receivable 88,399 73,200 21 Premises and equipment 24,665 14,934 65 Goodwill, MSRs and other intangible assets 53,302 54,349 (2) Other assets 120,090 121,022 (1) Total assets $ 2,727,379 $ 2,622,532 4% Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks decreased primarily as a result of a shift in the deployment of cash in Treasury and CIO into short-term instruments in trading assets. Deposits with banks reflect the Firm’s placements of its excess cash with various central banks, including the Federal Reserve Banks. Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements reflected higher client activity in CIB, which was more than offset by the impact of netting, and the reduction in the deployment of cash in Treasury and CIO. For additional information, refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 49–53 and Note 10. Securities borrowed increased driven by higher demand for securities largely related to client-driven market-making activities in CIB. For additional information, refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 49–53 and Note 10. Trading assets increased compared with lower levels at year-end predominantly due to client-driven market-making activities in debt and equity instruments in CIB Markets, including prime brokerage. In addition, but to a lesser extent, trading assets increased in Treasury and CIO associated with the deployment of cash into short-term instruments. For additional information, refer to Notes 2 and 4. Investment securities increased primarily reflecting net purchases of U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) and U.S. Treasuries in Treasury and CIO. For additional information on Investment securities, refer to Corporate segment results on pages 41–42, Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 69, and Notes 2 and 9. Loans decreased reflecting: • lower consumer loans in the residential real estate portfolio, predominantly driven by loan sales in Home Lending, and • lower loans in CIB, primarily driven by a loan syndication and net paydowns, partially offset by increases in CB and AWM. The allowance for loan losses decreased largely driven by Consumer due to a $400 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses in the PCI residential real estate portfolio, reflecting continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies, partially offset by a $200 million addition to the allowance in the credit card portfolio, due to loan growth and higher loss rates, as anticipated. For a more detailed discussion of loans and the allowance for loan losses, refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 54–69, and Notes 2, 3, 11 and 12. Accrued interest and accounts receivable increased reflecting higher client receivables related to client-driven market-making activities in CIB Fixed Income Markets, as well as higher receivables in CCB related to the timing of payment activities in Card Services, due to the end of the quarter falling on a weekend. Premises and equipment increased due to the adoption of the new lease accounting guidance effective January 1, 2019. For additional information, refer to Note 16. For information on Goodwill and MSRs, refer to Note 14. 16 Selected Consolidated balance sheets data (continued) (in millions) June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Change Liabilities Deposits $ 1,524,361 $ 1,470,666 4% Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements 201,683 182,320 11 Short-term borrowings 59,890 69,276 (14) Trading liabilities 147,639 144,773 2 Accounts payable and other liabilities 216,137 196,710 10 Beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest entities (“VIEs”) 25,585 20,241 26 Long-term debt 288,869 282,031 2 Total liabilities 2,464,164 2,366,017 4 Stockholders’ equity 263,215 256,515 3 Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 2,727,379 $ 2,622,532 4% Deposits increased due to growth in CIB from client activity in Securities Services and Treasury Services, and net issuances of structured notes in Markets, as well as continued growth in new accounts in CCB. Deposits in CB and AWM were relatively stable. For additional information, refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 49–53 and Notes 2 and 15. Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements increased primarily due to higher secured financing of trading assets-debt and equity instruments and client-driven market-making activities in CIB. For additional information, refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 49–53 and Note 10. Short-term borrowings decreased reflecting lower short- term advances from Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLB”) and commercial paper in Treasury and CIO primarily due to short-term liquidity management. For additional information, refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 49–53. Trading liabilities increased modestly as a result of client- driven market-making activities in CIB, which resulted in higher levels of short positions in debt instruments in Fixed Income Markets, largely offset by a decline in short positions in equity instruments, primarily in prime brokerage. For additional information, refer to Notes 2 and 4. Accounts payable and other liabilities increased reflecting: • the impact of the adoption of the new lease accounting guidance effective January 1, 2019 • higher payables in CCB related to the timing of payment activities in Card Services, due to the end of the quarter falling on a weekend. For additional information on Leases, refer to Note 16. Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs increased due to: • higher levels of Firm-administered multi-seller conduit commercial paper issued to third parties partially offset by • maturities of credit card securitizations. For further information on Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts, refer to Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements on page 18 and Notes 13 and 22. Long-term debt increased primarily due to client-driven net issuances of structured notes in CIB Markets, and in Treasury and CIO, from the net issuances of senior debt, partially offset by lower FHLB advances. For additional information on the Firm’s long-term debt activities, refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 49–53. For information on changes in stockholders’ equity, refer to page 83, and on the Firm’s capital actions, refer to Capital actions on pages 46–47. 17 Consolidated cash flows analysis The following is a discussion of cash flow activities during the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. (in millions) Six months ended June 30, 2019 2018 Net cash provided by/(used in) Operating activities $ (94,734) $ 576 Investing activities 27,424 (38,974) Financing activities 56,469 13,766 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 86 (1,492) Net decrease in cash and due from banks and deposits with banks $ (10,755) $ (26,124) Operating activities • In 2019, cash used primarily resulted from higher trading assets-debt and equity instruments, securities borrowed, accrued interest and accounts receivable and other assets, partially offset by higher trading liabilities, and net proceeds from loans originated for sale. • In 2018, cash provided primarily resulted from higher trading liabilities-debt and equity instruments and accounts payable and other liabilities, offset by higher trading assets-debt and equity instruments. Investing activities • In 2019, cash provided resulted from lower securities purchased under resale agreements, and net proceeds from the sale of loans held-for-investment, partially offset by net purchases of investment securities. • In 2018, cash used resulted from higher securities purchased under resale agreements and net loans originated, partially offset by net proceeds from investment securities. Financing activities • In 2019, cash provided resulted from higher deposits and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, partially offset by net payments on long-term borrowings. • In 2018, cash provided resulted from higher securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, short-term borrowings and deposits, partially offset by net payments on long-term borrowings. • For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of common stock and cash dividends on common and preferred stock. * * * For a further discussion of the activities affecting the Firm’s cash flows, refer to Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 15–17, Capital Risk Management on pages 44–48, and Liquidity Risk Management on pages 49–53 of this Form 10-Q, and pages 95–100 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. 18 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into various off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Certain obligations are recognized on-balance sheet, while others are disclosed off-balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). Special-purpose entities The Firm has several types of off–balance sheet arrangements, including through nonconsolidated special-purpose entities (“SPEs”), which are a type of VIE, and through lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees). The Firm holds capital, as appropriate, against all SPE-related transactions and related exposures, such as derivative contracts and lending-related commitments and guarantees. The Firm has no commitments to issue its own stock to support any SPE transaction, and its policies require that transactions with SPEs be conducted at arm’s length and reflect market pricing. Consistent with this policy, no JPMorgan Chase employee is permitted to invest in SPEs with which the Firm is involved where such investment would violate the Firm’s Code of Conduct. The table below provides an index of where in this Form 10-Q a discussion of the Firm’s various off-balance sheet arrangements can be found. In addition, refer to Note 1 for information about the Firm’s consolidation policies. Type of off-balance sheet arrangement Location of disclosure Page references Special-purpose entities: variable interests and other obligations, including contingent obligations, arising from variable interests in nonconsolidated VIEs Refer to Note 13 138-143 Off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees, and other commitments Refer to Note 22 155-158 19 EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and this presentation is referred to as “reported” basis; these financial statements appear on pages 80–84. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at the Firmwide and segment level. These non-GAAP measures include: • Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the overhead ratio, which include certain reclassifications to present total net revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities (“FTE” basis) • Net interest income and net yield excluding CIB’s Markets businesses • Certain credit metrics and ratios, which exclude PCI loans • Tangible common equity (“TCE”), ROTCE, and TBVPS. In addition, core loans is a key performance measure utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing actual growth in the loan portfolio.

(c) For further information on CIB’s Markets businesses, refer to page 31. (d) In the second quarter of 2019, the Firm reclassified balances related to certain instruments from interest-earning to noninterest-earning assets, as the associated returns are recorded in principal transactions revenue and not in net interest income. These changes were applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised to conform with the current presentation. The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity to TCE.

There are four major reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. For a definition of managed basis, refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non- GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Measures on pages 19–20. Description of business segment reporting methodology Results of the business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were essentially a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items. For further information about line of business capital, refer to Line of business equity on page 46. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and further refinements may be implemented in future periods. Business segment capital allocation The amount of capital assigned to each business is referred to as equity. On at least an annual basis, the assumptions and methodologies used in capital allocation are assessed and as a result, the capital allocated to lines of business may change. For additional information on business segment capital allocation, refer to Line of business equity on page 91 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. For a further discussion of those methodologies, refer to Business Segment Results – Description of business segment reporting methodology on pages 60–61 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K.

(a) Included operating lease depreciation expense of $959 million and $827 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $1.9 billion and $1.6 billion for six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. (b) Included MSR risk management results of $(244) million and $(23) million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively and $(253) million and $(6) million for six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 23 Quarterly results Net income was $4.2 billion, an increase of 22%. Net revenue was $13.8 billion, an increase of 11%. Net interest income was $9.4 billion, up 7%, driven by: • higher deposit margins and balance growth in CBB, as well as higher loan balances and margin expansion in Card, partially offset by • loan spread compression and lower loan balances in Home Lending. Noninterest revenue was $4.4 billion, up 18%, including the impact of the prior-year adjustment of approximately $330 million to the credit card rewards liability, predominantly offset by lower MSR risk management results reflecting updates to model inputs. Excluding these notable items, noninterest revenue was up 16%, largely driven by: • higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting higher mortgage production margins and volumes, as well as the impact of loan sales in Home Lending, and • higher auto lease volume, partially offset by • lower operating revenue reflecting faster prepayment speeds on lower rates. Refer to Note 14 for further information regarding changes in value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and mortgage fees and related income. Noninterest expense was $7.2 billion, up 4%, largely driven by: • technology, marketing and other investments in the business, as well as higher auto lease depreciation, partially offset by • expense efficiencies and lower FDIC charges. The provision for credit losses was $1.1 billion, relatively flat compared with the prior year, reflecting: • an increase in credit card due to – a $200 million addition to the allowance for loan losses reflecting loan growth and higher loss rates, as anticipated, and – higher net charge-offs, on loan growth offset by • a decrease in consumer, excluding credit card due to – a $400 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses in the PCI residential real estate portfolio, reflecting continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies partially offset by – higher net charge-offs in the residential real estate portfolio as the prior year benefited from a recovery on a loan sale. Year-to-date results Net income was $8.1 billion, an increase of 21%. Net revenue was $27.6 billion, an increase of 10%. Net interest income was $18.8 billion, up 9%, driven by: • higher deposit margins and balance growth in CBB, as well as higher loan balances and margin expansion in Card, partially offset by • loan spread compression and lower loan balances in Home Lending. Noninterest revenue was $8.8 billion, up 11%, including the impact of the prior-year adjustment of approximately $330 million to the credit card rewards liability, predominantly offset by lower MSR risk management results reflecting updates to model inputs. Excluding these notable items, noninterest revenue was up 10%, largely driven by: • higher auto lease volume, and • higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting higher mortgage production margins and volumes, as well as the impact of loan sales in Home Lending, partially offset by • lower operating revenue reflecting lower servicing revenue on a lower level of third-party loans serviced and faster prepayment speeds on lower rates. Noninterest expense was $14.4 billion, up 4%, driven by: • technology, marketing and other investments in the business, as well as higher auto lease depreciation, partially offset by • expense efficiencies and lower FDIC charges. The provision for credit losses was $2.4 billion, flat compared with the prior year, reflecting: • an increase in credit card due to – a $200 million addition to the allowance for loan losses reflecting loan growth and higher loss rates, as anticipated, and – higher net charge-offs, on loan growth offset by • a decrease in consumer, excluding credit card due to – a $400 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses in the PCI residential real estate portfolio, reflecting continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies partially offset by – higher net charge-offs in the residential real estate portfolio as the prior year benefited from a recovery on a loan sale. 24 Selected metrics As of or for the three months ended June 30, As of or for the six months ended June 30, (in millions, except headcount) 2019 2018 Change 2019 2018 Change Selected balance sheet data (period-end) Total assets $ 550,690 $ 552,674 — % $ 550,690 $ 552,674 — % Loans: Consumer & Business Banking 26,616 26,272 1 26,616 26,272 1 Home equity 32,958 39,033 (16) 32,958 39,033 (16) Residential mortgage 186,575 202,205 (8) 186,575 202,205 (8) Home Lending 219,533 241,238 (9) 219,533 241,238 (9) Card 157,576 145,255 8 157,576 145,255 8 Auto 62,073 65,014 (5) 62,073 65,014 (5) Total loans 465,798 477,779 (3) 465,798 477,779 (3) Core loans 418,177 419,295 — 418,177 419,295 — Deposits 695,100 679,154 2 695,100 679,154 2 Equity 52,000 51,000 2 52,000 51,000 2 Selected balance sheet data (average) Total assets $ 542,337 $ 544,642 — $ 548,053 $ 541,806 1 Loans: Consumer & Business Banking 26,570 26,110 2 26,529 25,978 2 Home equity 33,676 39,898 (16) 34,446 40,836 (16) Residential mortgage 191,009 201,587 (5) 197,332 200,129 (1) Home Lending 224,685 241,485 (7) 231,778 240,965 (4) Card 153,746 142,724 8 152,447 142,825 7 Auto 62,236 65,383 (5) 62,498 65,622 (5) Total loans 467,237 475,702 (2) 473,252 475,390 — Core loans 418,470 414,120 1 423,315 412,145 3 Deposits 690,892 673,761 3 685,980 666,719 3 Equity 52,000 51,000 2 52,000 51,000 2 Headcount(a) 127,732 131,945 (3)% 127,732 131,945 (3)% (a) During the third quarter of 2018, approximately 1,200 employees transferred from CCB to CIB as part of the reorganization of the Commercial Card business. 25 Selected metrics As of or for the three months ended June 30, As of or for the six months ended June 30, (in millions, except ratio data) 2019 2018 Change 2019 2018 Change Credit data and quality statistics Nonaccrual loans(a)(b) $ 3,142 $ 3,854 (18)% $ 3,142 $ 3,854 (18)% Net charge-offs/(recoveries)(c) Consumer & Business Banking 66 50 32 125 103 21 Home equity (16) (7) (129) (16) 9 NM Residential mortgage (12) (149) 92 (17) (147) 88 Home Lending (28) (156) 82 (33) (138) 76 Card 1,240 1,164 7 2,442 2,334 5 Auto 42 50 (16) 100 126 (21) Total net charge-offs/(recoveries) $ 1,320 $ 1,108 19 $ 2,634 $ 2,425 9 Net charge-off/(recovery) rate(c) Consumer & Business Banking 1.00% 0.77% 0.95% 0.80% Home equity(d) (0.25) (0.09) (0.12) 0.06 Residential mortgage(d) (0.03) (0.33) (0.02) (0.16) Home Lending(d) (0.06) (0.29) (0.03) (0.13) Card 3.24 3.27 3.23 3.30 Auto 0.27 0.31 0.32 0.39 Total net charge-off/(recovery) rate(d) 1.19 1.00 1.18 1.10 30+ day delinquency rate Home Lending(e)(f) 0.71% 0.86% 0.71% 0.86% Card 1.71 1.65 1.71 1.65 Auto 0.82 0.77 0.82 0.77 90+ day delinquency rate — Card 0.87 0.85 0.87 0.85 Allowance for loan losses Consumer & Business Banking $ 796 $ 796 — $ 796 $ 796 — Home Lending, excluding PCI loans 1,003 1,003 — 1,003 1,003 — Home Lending — PCI loans(c) 1,299 2,132 (39) 1,299 2,132 (39) Card 5,383 4,884 10 5,383 4,884 10 Auto 465 464 — 465 464 — Total allowance for loan losses(c) $ 8,946 $ 9,279 (4)% $ 8,946 $ 9,279 (4)% (a) Excludes PCI loans.

(b) Formerly Markets & Investor Services. 28 Quarterly results Net income was $2.9 billion, down 8%. Net revenue was $9.6 billion, down 3%. Banking revenue was $3.2 billion, down 6%. • Investment Banking revenue was $1.8 billion, down 9%, reflecting lower fees across products. The Firm maintained its #1 ranking for Global Investment Banking fees, according to Dealogic. – Debt underwriting fees were $816 million, down 13%, driven by declines in industry-wide fee levels. – Advisory fees were $525 million, down 16% and Equity underwriting fees were $505 million, down 11%, driven by declines in industry-wide fee levels and when compared to a strong prior year. • Treasury Services revenue was $1.1 billion, down 4%, predominantly driven by deposit margin compression, largely offset by growth in operating deposits and higher fees on increased payments volume. • Lending revenue was $337 million, up 5%, predominantly driven by higher net interest income reflecting growth in loan balances. Markets & Securities Services revenue was $6.4 billion, down 1%. Markets revenue was $5.4 billion, flat compared to the prior year, and included a gain from the IPO of a strategic investment in Tradeweb. Excluding this gain, total Markets revenue and Fixed Income Markets revenue were down 6% and 3% respectively. • Fixed Income Markets revenue was $3.7 billion reflecting relative weakness in EMEA across products, largely offset by increased client activity in North America Rates and agency mortgage trading due to the changing rate environment. • Equity Markets revenue was $1.7 billion, down 12% compared to a strong prior year, predominantly driven by lower client activity in derivatives. • Securities Services revenue was $1.0 billion, down 5%, driven by deposit margin compression and the impact of a business exit, partially offset by increased client activity. The provision for credit losses was zero, compared with $58 million in the prior year. Noninterest expense was $5.5 billion, up 2%, reflecting higher legal expense, largely offset by lower performance- related compensation expense. Year-to-date results Net income was $6.2 billion, down 14%. Net revenue was $19.5 billion, down 4%. Banking revenue was $6.5 billion, flat compared to the prior year. • Investment Banking revenue was $3.5 billion, flat compared to the prior year, driven by lower equity underwriting and advisory fees, partially offset by higher debt underwriting fees. The Firm maintained its #1 ranking for Global Investment Banking fees with overall share gains, according to Dealogic. – Equity underwriting fees were $770 million, down 16% and Advisory fees were $1.2 billion, down 3%, driven by declines in industry-wide fee levels. – Although industry-wide fee levels declined, Debt underwriting fees of $1.8 billion were up 2%, driven by large acquisition financing deals. • Treasury Services revenue was $2.3 billion, down 1%, reflecting deposit margin compression offset by growth in operating deposits and higher fees on increased payments volume. • Lending revenue was $677 million, up 9%, predominantly driven by higher net interest income reflecting growth in loan balances. Markets & Securities Services revenue was $13.0 billion, down 7%. Markets revenue was $10.9 billion, which included a gain from the IPO of a strategic investment in Tradeweb. In addition, prior year results included approximately $500 million of fair value gains related to the adoption of the recognition and measurement accounting guidance for certain equity investments previously held at cost. Excluding these gains, total Markets revenue and Fixed Income Markets revenue were down 8% and 6% respectively. • Fixed Income Markets revenue was $7.4 billion reflecting lower revenue in Currencies & Emerging Markets and Rates. This decline was partially offset by higher revenue in agency mortgage trading due to the changing rate environment. • Equity Markets revenue was $3.5 billion, down 13% compared to a strong prior year, predominantly driven by lower client activity in derivatives. • Securities Services revenue was $2.1 billion, down 5%, driven by deposit margin compression and the impact of a business exit, partially offset by increased client activity. • Credit Adjustments & Other was a gain of $66 million, compared with a loss of $194 million in the prior year. The provision for credit losses was $87 million reflecting select C&I client downgrades. The prior year was a benefit of $100 million, reflecting a reduction in the allowance for credit losses primarily driven by a single name in the Oil & Gas portfolio, partially offset by net portfolio activity. Noninterest expense was $10.9 billion, down 1%, reflecting lower performance-related compensation expense and lower FDIC charges partially offset by higher investments in technology and higher legal expense. 29 Selected metrics As of or for the three months ended June 30, As of or for the six months ended June 30, (in millions, except headcount) 2019 2018 Change 2019 2018 Change Selected balance sheet data (period-end) Assets $ 962,498 $ 908,954 6% $ 962,498 $ 908,954 6% Loans: Loans retained(a) 123,074 116,645 6 123,074 116,645 6 Loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value 6,838 6,254 9 6,838 6,254 9 Total loans 129,912 122,899 6 129,912 122,899 6 Core loans 129,747 122,574 6 129,747 122,574 6 Equity 80,000 70,000 14 80,000 70,000 14 Selected balance sheet data (average) Assets $ 992,792 $ 937,217 6 $ 976,408 $ 923,756 6 Trading assets-debt and equity instruments 421,775 358,611 18 401,656 356,750 13 Trading assets-derivative receivables 48,815 60,623 (19) 49,707 60,393 (18) Loans: Loans retained(a) $ 124,194 $ 113,950 9 $ 125,585 $ 111,665 12 Loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value 7,763 5,961 30 8,186 5,722 43 Total loans $ 131,957 $ 119,911 10 $ 133,771 $ 117,387 14 Core loans 131,792 119,637 10 133,596 117,090 14 Equity 80,000 70,000 14 80,000 70,000 14 Headcount(b) 54,959 51,400 7% 54,959 51,400 7% (a) Loans retained includes credit portfolio loans, loans held by consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, trade finance loans, other held-for- investment loans and overdrafts.

Markets includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue comprises principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are recorded in principal transactions revenue. For a description of the composition of these income statement line items, refer to Notes 5 and 6. For further information, refer to Markets revenue on page 69 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. For the periods presented below, the predominant source of principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized upon executing new transactions.

Quarterly results Net income was $828 million, compared with a net loss of $136 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $322 million, compared with $80 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by higher net interest income on higher rates and change in balance sheet mix, as well as an increase in investment securities gains due to the repositioning of the investment securities portfolio, partially offset by approximately $100 million of net valuation losses on certain legacy private equity investments compared to net gains in the prior year. Noninterest expense was $232 million, compared with $279 million in the prior year. The current period included investments in technology as well as a contribution to the Firm’s Foundation, whereas all prior-year contributions were made in the fourth quarter. The prior year included a $174 million pretax loss on the liquidation of a legal entity. The current period included tax benefits of $742 million related to the resolution of certain tax audits. The prior period reflected a benefit of $189 million resulting from a change in the estimate for the deemed repatriation tax on non-U.S. earnings, as well as other net tax adjustments that were predominantly offset by changes to certain tax reserves. Year-to-date results Net income was $1,079 million, compared with a net loss of $519 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $747 million, compared with a net loss of $152 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by higher net interest income on higher rates and change in balance sheet mix, as well as an increase in investment securities gains due to the repositioning of the investment securities portfolio. Noninterest expense was $443 million, compared with $366 million in the prior year.

The impact of risk and control issues are carefully considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and incentive compensation processes. Firmwide Risk Management is overseen and managed on an enterprise-wide basis. The Firm’s risk management governance and oversight framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts of risks. For a further discussion of Enterprise-wide risk management governance and oversight, refer to pages 79-83 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Effective July 2019, the Board of Directors’ Risk Policy Committee (“DRPC”) was renamed the Risk Committee. The committee’s responsibilities were not changed. For a further discussion of the committee, refer to page 81 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Governance and Oversight Functions The following sections of this Form 10-Q and the 2018 Form 10-K discuss the risk governance and oversight functions in place to manage the risks inherent in the Firm’s business activities.

For a further discussion of the Firm’s Capital Risk Management, including capital planning and stress testing, refer to pages 85-94 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K, Note 21 of this Form 10-Q, and the Firm’s Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website (https:// jpmorganchaseco.gcs-web.com/financial-information/basel- pillar-3-us-lcr-disclosures). The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. bank holding companies (“BHC”) and banks, including the Firm and its insured depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). Effective January 1, 2019, the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the fully phased- in measures under Basel III and represents the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches. During 2018, the required capital measures were subject to the transitional rules and as of December 31, 2018 were the same on a fully phased-in and on a transitional basis. The Firm’s Basel III Standardized risk-based ratios are currently more binding than the Basel III Advanced risk-based ratios, and the Firm expects that this will remain the case for the foreseeable future. Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced Approach banking organizations, including the Firm, to calculate the SLR. For additional information on SLR, refer to page 91 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. In addition to meeting the capital ratio requirements of Basel III, the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries also must maintain minimum capital and leverage ratios in order to be “well-capitalized” under the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and the Prompt Corrective Action requirements of the FDIC Improvement Act respectively. The following tables present the Firm’s risk-based and leverage-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and Advanced Approaches. The Firm’s Basel III ratios exceeded regulatory minimums as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. For a further discussion of these capital metrics, refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 85-94 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K.

Line of business equity Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. Effective January 1, 2019, line of business capital allocations have increased due to a combination of changes in the relative weights, with greater emphasis on Standardized RWA and stress, a higher capitalization rate, updated stress simulations, and general business growth. For additional information, refer to page 91 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. The following table represents the capital allocated to each business segment: (in billions) June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Consumer & Community Banking $ 52.0 $ 51.0 Corporate & Investment Bank 80.0 70.0 Commercial Banking 22.0 20.0 Asset & Wealth Management 10.5 9.0 Corporate 71.7 80.4 Total common stockholders’ equity $ 236.2 $ 230.4 Planning and stress testing Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) The Federal Reserve requires large bank holding companies, including the Firm, to submit on an annual basis a capital plan that has been reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors. Through CCAR, the Federal Reserve evaluates each bank holding company’s (“BHC”) capital adequacy and internal capital adequacy assessment processes (“ICAAP”), as well as its plans to make capital distributions, such as dividend payments or stock repurchases. On June 27, 2019, the Federal Reserve informed the Firm that it did not object to the Firm’s 2019 capital plan. Capital actions Preferred stock Preferred stock dividends declared were $404 million and $778 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. On July 31, 2019, the Firm issued $2.25 billion of fixed-to- floating rate non-cumulative preferred stock, Series FF, and on August 2, 2019, the Firm announced that it will redeem all $880 million of its 6.30% non-cumulative preferred stock, Series W on September 1, 2019. For additional information on the Firm’s preferred stock, refer to Note 17 of this Form 10-Q and Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. 47 Common stock dividends The Firm’s second quarter common stock dividend was $0.80 per share. On June 27, 2019, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors intends to increase the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.90 per share, effective the third quarter of 2019. The Firm’s dividends are subject to the Board of Directors’ approval on a quarterly basis. Common equity Effective June 27, 2019, the Firm’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $29.4 billion of gross common equity between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020, as part of the Firm’s annual capital plan. The following table sets forth the Firm’s repurchases of common equity, on a settlement-date basis, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.

Other capital requirements TLAC The Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule requires the top-tier U.S. GSIB holding companies, including the Firm, to maintain minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible LTD effective January 1, 2019. For additional information, refer to page 93 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. The following table presents the eligible external TLAC and LTD amounts, as well as a representation of the amounts as a percentage of the Firm’s total RWA and total leverage exposure.

Morgan Securities JPMorgan Chase’s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary is J.P. Morgan Securities. J.P. Morgan Securities is subject to Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Net Capital Rule”). J.P. Morgan Securities is also registered as a futures commission merchant and subject to Rule 1.17 of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). For a discussion on J.P. Morgan Securities’ capital requirements, refer to Capital risk management on pages 85-94 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. The following table presents J.P. Morgan Securities’ net capital: June 30, 2019 (in millions) Actual Minimum Net Capital $ 20,858 $ 3,446 J.P. Morgan Securities plc J.P. Morgan Securities plc is a wholly-owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and has authority to engage in banking, investment banking and broker-dealer activities. J.P. Morgan Securities plc is jointly regulated by the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) and the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”). For a further discussion on J.P. Morgan Securities plc, refer to Capital risk management on pages 85-94 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Effective January 1, 2019, the Bank of England requires, on a transitional basis, that U.K. banks, including U.K. regulated subsidiaries of overseas groups, maintain a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (“MREL”). As of June 30, 2019, J.P. Morgan Securities plc was compliant with the requirements of the MREL rule. For additional information on MREL, refer to Supervision and Regulation on pages 1-6 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. The following table presents J.P. Morgan Securities plc’s capital metrics: June 30, 2019 (in millions, except ratios) Estimated Minimum ratios Total capital $ 55,598 CET1 ratio 17.9% 4.5% Total capital ratio 22.9% 8.0% 49 LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount, composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support its assets and liabilities. For a further discussion of the Firm’s Liquidity Risk Management, refer to pages 95–100 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K and the Firm’s US LCR Disclosure reports, which are available on the Firm’s website at: (https://jpmorganchaseco.gcs-web.com/ financial-information/basel-pillar-3-us-lcr-disclosures). LCR and HQLA The LCR rule requires the Firm to maintain an amount of unencumbered HQLA that is sufficient to meet its estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress. HQLA is the amount of liquid assets that qualify for inclusion in the LCR. HQLA primarily consist of unencumbered cash and certain high-quality liquid securities as defined in the LCR rule. The LCR is required to be a minimum of 100%. Under the LCR rule, the amount of HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. that is in excess of its standalone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s reported HQLA. The following table summarizes the Firm’s average LCR for the three months ended June 30, 2019, March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018 based on the Firm’s interpretation of the finalized LCR framework. Three months ended Average amount (in millions) June 30, 2019 March 31, 2019 June 30, 2018 HQLA Eligible cash(a) $ 219,838 $ 216,787 $ 362,608 Eligible securities(b)(c) 317,439 303,249 166,427 Total HQLA(d) $ 537,277 $ 520,036 $ 529,035 Net cash outflows $ 477,442 $ 467,329 $ 458,432 LCR 113% 111% 115% Net excess HQLA(d) $ 59,835 $ 52,707 $ 70,603 (a) Represents cash on deposit at central banks, primarily the Federal Reserve Banks. (b) Predominantly U.S. Treasuries, U.S. Agency MBS, and sovereign bonds net of applicable haircuts under the LCR rules. (c) HQLA eligible securities may be reported in securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements, trading assets, or investment securities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. (d) Excludes average excess HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The Firm’s average LCR increased during the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared with the three-month period ended March 31, 2019, primarily from an increase in cash from unsecured long-term debt issuances. Additionally, liquidity in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. increased during the quarter due to growth in stable deposits and a reduction in loans, however this increase in excess liquidity is excluded from the Firm’s reported LCR under the LCR rule. The Firm’s average LCR decreased during the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared with the prior year period. The decrease in the LCR was driven by a decrease in the amount of HQLA in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that was determined to be transferable to non-bank affiliates based on a change in the Firm’s interpretation of amounts available for transfer during the three months ended December 31, 2018. This change in interpretation had no impact on the HQLA in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. which had increased over the period. The Firm’s average LCR may fluctuate from period to period, due to changes in its HQLA and estimated net cash outflows under the LCR as a result of ongoing business activity. Other liquidity sources As of June 30, 2019, in addition to assets reported in the Firm’s HQLA under the LCR rule, the Firm had approximately $277 billion of unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity securities and fixed income debt securities, available to raise liquidity, if required. This includes HQLA- eligible securities included as part of the excess liquidity at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non- bank affiliates. As of June 30, 2019, the Firm also had approximately $314 billion of available borrowing capacity at FHLBs, the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank, and various other central banks as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of securities reported in the Firm’s HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window. Although available, the Firm does not view the borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the various other central banks as a primary source of liquidity. 50 Funding Sources of funds Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance sheet obligations. The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including stable deposits as well as secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets. The Firm’s loan portfolio is funded with a portion of the Firm’s deposits, through securitizations and, with respect to a portion of the Firm’s real estate-related loans, with secured borrowings from the FHLBs. Deposits in excess of the amount utilized to fund loans are primarily invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics. Securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements and trading assets-debt and equity instruments are primarily funded by the Firm’s securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, trading liabilities-debt and equity instruments, and a portion of the Firm’s long-term debt and stockholders’ equity. In addition to funding securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements and trading assets-debt and equity instruments, proceeds from the Firm’s debt and equity issuances are used to fund certain loans and other financial and non-financial assets, or may be invested in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio. Refer to the discussion below for additional information relating to Deposits, Short- term funding, and Long-term funding and issuance. Deposits The table below summarizes, by line of business, the deposit balances as of June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, and the average deposit balances for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, Deposits Average Average (in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Consumer & Community Banking $ 695,100 $ 678,854 $ 690,892 $ 673,761 $ 685,980 $ 666,719 Corporate & Investment Bank 523,364 482,084 512,098 475,697 502,280 470,788 Commercial Banking 169,100 170,859 168,194 170,665 167,688 173,081 Asset & Wealth Management 136,225 138,546 140,317 139,557 139,282 141,865 Corporate 572 323 793 815 878 839 Total Firm $ 1,524,361 $ 1,470,666 $ 1,512,294 $ 1,460,495 $ 1,496,108 $ 1,453,292 Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer and wholesale operating deposits, which are both considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of liquidity because they are generated from customers that maintain operating service relationships with the Firm. The table below shows the loan and deposit balances, the loans-to-deposits ratios, and deposits as a percentage of total liabilities, as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. (in billions except ratios) June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Deposits $ 1,524.4 $ 1,470.7 Deposits as a % of total liabilities 62% 62% Loans $ 956.9 $ 984.6 Loans-to-deposits ratio 63% 67% The Firm believes that average deposit balances are generally more representative of deposit trends than period-end deposit balances. Average deposits increased for the three months ended June 30, 2019 in CIB, CCB and AWM, partially offset by a decline in CB. • The increase in CIB reflects an increase in deposits in Treasury Services and Securities Services driven by growth in client activity, and an increase in the net issuances of structured notes in Markets. The increase in CCB was driven by growth in new accounts. The increase in AWM was driven by growth in time deposits, partially offset by migration predominantly into the Firm’s investment-related products. • The decrease in CB was primarily driven by lower non- operating deposits. Average deposits increased for the six months ended June 30, 2019 in CIB and CCB, partially offset by declines in CB and AWM. • The increase in CIB reflects an increase in deposits in Treasury Services driven by growth in client activity, and an increase in the net issuances of structured notes in Markets. The increase in CCB was driven by growth in new accounts. • The decrease in CB was primarily driven by lower non- operating deposits. The decrease in AWM was largely driven by migration predominantly into the Firm’s investment-related products.

Short-term funding The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly by high-quality securities collateral, including government- issued debt and agency MBS, and constitute a significant portion of the federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements on the Consolidated balance sheets. The increase at June 30, 2019, from December 31, 2018, reflected higher secured financing of trading assets-debt and equity instruments and client-driven market-making activities in CIB. The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to customers’ investment and financing activities, the Firm’s demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured financing (for both the investment securities and market- making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors. The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding primarily consist of issuance of wholesale commercial paper. The decrease in commercial paper at June 30, 2019, from December 31, 2018, was due to lower net issuance primarily for short-term liquidity management. 52 Long-term funding and issuance Long-term funding provides additional sources of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan. The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide maximum flexibility in support of both bank and nonbank subsidiary funding needs. The Parent Company advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the Intermediate Holding Company (“IHC”). The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties. The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. For additional information on the IHC and long-term debt, refer to Liquidity Risk Management and Note 19 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K.

The Firm raises secured long-term funding through securitization of consumer credit card loans and advances from the FHLBs. The following table summarizes the securitization issuance and FHLB advances and their respective maturities or redemptions for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

The Firm’s wholesale businesses also securitize loans for client-driven transactions; those client-driven loan securitizations are not considered to be a source of funding for the Firm and are not included in the table above. For further description of the client-driven loan securitizations, refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. 53 Credit ratings The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors, which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades. Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and other third-party commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in credit ratings. For additional information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on the funding requirements for VIEs, and on derivatives and collateral agreements, refer to SPEs on page 18, and liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features in Note 4. The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of June 30, 2019, were as follows. JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.(a) J.P.

These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”). 55 CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO The Firm’s retained consumer portfolio consists primarily of residential real estate loans, credit card loans, auto loans, and business banking loans, as well as associated lending-related commitments. The Firm’s focus is on serving primarily the prime segment of the consumer credit market.

(b) Includes certain business banking and auto dealer risk-rated loans that apply the wholesale methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses; these loans are managed by CCB, and therefore, for consistency in presentation, are included within the consumer portfolio. (c) Predominantly includes Business Banking loans. (d) Credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available lines of credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit would be used at the same time. For credit card commitments, and if certain conditions are met, home equity commitments, the Firm can reduce or cancel these lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. For further information, refer to Note 22. (e) Includes billed interest and fees net of an allowance for uncollectible interest and fees. (f) At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of $1.8 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. These amounts have been excluded from nonaccrual loans based upon the government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status, as permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the FFIEC. (g) Excludes PCI loans. The Firm is recognizing interest income on each pool of PCI loans as each of the pools is performing. (h) Net charge-offs/(recoveries) and the net charge-off/(recovery) rates excluded write-offs in the PCI portfolio of $39 million and $73 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $89 million and $93 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These write-offs decreased the allowance for loan losses for PCI loans. Refer to Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 67–68 for further information. (i) Average consumer loans held-for-sale were $1.2 billion and $291 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $1.2 billion and $263 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These amounts were excluded when calculating net charge-off/(recovery) rates. 56 Consumer, excluding credit card Portfolio analysis Loan balances decreased from December 31, 2018 due to lower consumer loans in the residential real estate portfolio, predominantly driven by loan sales in Home Lending. The credit performance of the portfolio continues to benefit from a strong labor market and continued improvement in home prices. The following discussions provide information concerning individual loan products, excluding PCI loans which are addressed separately. For further information about this portfolio, including information about delinquencies, loan modifications and other credit quality indicators, refer to Note 11 of this Form 10-Q. Residential mortgage: The residential mortgage portfolio, including loans held-for-sale, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans. The portfolio decreased from December 31, 2018 driven by loan sales in Home Lending as well as paydowns, partially offset by originations of prime mortgage loans that have been retained on the balance sheet. Net recoveries for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were lower when compared with the same periods in the prior year as the prior year benefited from a recovery on a loan sale. At June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, the Firm’s residential mortgage portfolio included $21.8 billion and $21.6 billion, respectively, of interest-only loans. These loans have an interest-only payment period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to maturity and are typically originated as higher-balance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly in AWM. Performance of this portfolio for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 was in line with the performance of the broader residential mortgage portfolio for the same period. The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, including loans held-for-sale. The Firm monitors its exposure to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related to government- insured loans and considers this exposure in estimating the allowance for loan losses. (in millions) June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Current $ 2,319 $ 2,884 30-89 days past due 1,080 1,528 90 or more days past due 1,809 2,600 Total government guaranteed loans $ 5,208 $ 7,012 Home equity: The home equity portfolio declined from December 31, 2018 primarily reflecting loan paydowns. At June 30, 2019, approximately 90% of the Firm’s home equity portfolio consisted of home equity lines of credit (“HELOCs”) and the remainder consisted of home equity loans (“HELOANs”). The carrying value of HELOCs outstanding was $24 billion at June 30, 2019. This amount included $10 billion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have been modified and $4 billion of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material deterioration in their credit risk profile. For further information on the Firm’s home equity portfolio, refer to Note 11 of this Form 10-Q and Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 106–111 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Auto: The auto loan portfolio predominantly consists of prime-quality loans. The portfolio declined when compared with December 31, 2018, as paydowns and charge-offs or liquidation of delinquent loans were predominantly offset by new originations. Consumer & Business Banking: Consumer & Business Banking loans were flat when compared with December 31, 2018 as loan originations were offset by paydowns and charge-offs of delinquent loans. Net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 increased when compared with the same period in the prior year due primarily to higher deposit overdraft losses. Purchased credit-impaired loans: PCI loans represent certain loans that were acquired and deemed to be credit- impaired on the acquisition date. PCI loans decreased from December 31, 2018 due to portfolio run off. As of June 30, 2019, approximately 10% of the option ARM PCI loans were delinquent and approximately 70% of the portfolio had been modified into fixed-rate, fully amortizing loans. The borrowers for substantially all of the remaining option ARM loans are making amortizing payments, although such payments are not necessarily fully amortizing. This latter group of loans is subject to the risk of payment shock due to future payment recast. Default rates generally increase on option ARM loans when payment recast results in a payment increase. The expected increase in default rates is considered in the Firm’s quarterly impairment assessment. 57 The following table provides a summary of lifetime principal loss estimates included in either the nonaccretable difference or the allowance for loan losses. Summary of PCI loans lifetime principal loss estimates Lifetime loss estimates(a) Life-to-date liquidation losses(b) (in billions) Jun 30, 2019 Dec 31, 2018 Jun 30, 2019 Dec 31, 2018 Home equity $ 13.9 $ 14.1 $ 13.0 $ 13.0 Prime mortgage 4.1 4.1 3.9 3.9 Subprime mortgage 3.3 3.3 3.2 3.2 Option ARMs 10.2 10.3 9.9 9.9 Total $ 31.5 $ 31.8 $ 30.0 $ 30.0 (a) Includes the original nonaccretable difference established in purchase accounting of $30.5 billion for principal losses plus additional principal losses recognized subsequent to acquisition through the provision and allowance for loan losses. The remaining nonaccretable difference for principal losses was $487 million and $512 million at June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. (b) Represents both realization of loss upon loan resolution and any principal forgiven upon modification. Geographic composition of residential real estate loans For information on the geographic composition of the Firm’s residential real estate loans, refer to Note 11. Current estimated loan-to-value ratio of residential real estate loans Average current estimated loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios have declined consistent with recent improvements in home prices, customer paydowns, and charge-offs or liquidations of higher LTV loans. For information on current estimated LTVs of the Firm’s residential real estate loans, refer to Note 11. Loan modification activities for residential real estate loans The performance of modified loans generally differs by product type due to differences in both the credit quality and the types of modifications provided. Performance metrics for modifications to the residential real estate portfolios as measured through redefault rates, were not materially different from December 31, 2018. For further information on the Firm’s redefault rates, refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 106–111 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Certain modified loans have interest rate reset provisions (“step-rate modifications”) where the interest rates on these loans generally began to increase commencing in 2014 by 1% per year, and will continue to do so, until the rate reaches a specified cap. The cap on these loans is typically at a prevailing market interest rate for a fixed-rate mortgage loan as of the modification date. At June 30, 2019, the carrying value of non-PCI loans and the unpaid principal balance of PCI loans modified in step-rate modifications, which have not yet met their specified caps, were $1.4 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. The Firm continues to monitor this risk exposure and the impact of these potential interest rate increases is considered in the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. The following table presents information as of June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, relating to modified retained residential real estate loans for which concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. For further information on modifications for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, refer to Note 11. Modified residential real estate loans June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 (in millions) Retained loans Non- accrual retained loans(d) Retained loans Non- accrual retained loans(d) Modified residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans(a)(b) Residential mortgage $ 4,381 $ 1,436 $ 4,565 $ 1,459 Home equity 1,954 946 2,012 955 Total modified residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans $ 6,335 $ 2,382 $ 6,577 $ 2,414 Modified PCI loans(c) Home equity $ 2,012 NA $ 2,086 NA Prime mortgage 3,024 NA 3,179 NA Subprime mortgage 1,971 NA 2,041 NA Option ARMs 6,080 NA 6,410 NA Total modified PCI loans $ 13,087 NA $ 13,716 NA (a) Amounts represent the carrying value of modified residential real estate loans. (b) At June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, $2.6 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, of loans modified subsequent to repurchase from Ginnie Mae in accordance with the standards of the appropriate government agency (i.e., Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), Rural Housing Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“RHS”)) are not included in the table above. When such loans perform subsequent to modification in accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines, they are generally sold back into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform become subject to foreclosure. For additional information about sales of loans in securitization transactions with Ginnie Mae, refer to Note 13. (c) Amounts represent the unpaid principal balance of modified PCI loans. (d) At both June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, nonaccrual loans included $2.0 billion of troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) for which the borrowers were less than 90 days past due. For additional information about loans modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual status, refer to Note 11. 58 Nonperforming assets The following table presents information as of June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, about consumer, excluding credit card, nonperforming assets. Nonperforming assets(a) (in millions) June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Nonaccrual loans(b) Residential real estate $ 2,931 $ 3,088 Other consumer 331 373 Total nonaccrual loans 3,262 3,461 Assets acquired in loan satisfactions Real estate owned 247 210 Other 26 30 Total assets acquired in loan satisfactions 273 240 Total nonperforming assets $ 3,535 $ 3,701 (a) At June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, nonperforming assets excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of $1.8 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, and REO insured by U.S. government agencies of $56 million and $75 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. (b) Excludes PCI loans, which are accounted for on a pool basis. Since each pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows, the past-due status of the pools, or that of individual loans within the pools, is not meaningful. The Firm is recognizing interest income on each pool of loans as each of the pools is performing. Nonaccrual loans in the residential real estate portfolio at June 30, 2019 decreased to $2.9 billion from $3.1 billion at December 31, 2018, of which 23% and 24% were greater than 150 days past due, respectively. In the aggregate, the unpaid principal balance of residential real estate loans greater than 150 days past due was charged down by approximately 31% and 32% to the estimated net realizable value of the collateral at June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. Nonaccrual loans: The following table presents changes in consumer, excluding credit card, nonaccrual loans for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. Nonaccrual loan activity Six months ended June 30, (in millions) 2019 2018 Beginning balance $ 3,461 $ 4,209 Additions 1,082 1,575 Reductions: Principal payments and other(a) 508 738 Charge-offs 209 246 Returned to performing status 435 666 Foreclosures and other liquidations 129 155 Total reductions 1,281 1,805 Net changes (199) (230) Ending balance $ 3,262 $ 3,979 (a) Other reductions includes loan sales. Active and suspended foreclosure: For information on loans that were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure, refer to Note 11. 59 Credit card Total credit card loans were relatively flat from December 31, 2018 reflecting increased sales volumes from existing customers and new account growth, offset by the impact of seasonality. The June 30, 2019 30+ day delinquency rate decreased to 1.71% from 1.83% at December 31, 2018, and the June 30, 2019 90+ day delinquency rate decreased to 0.87% from 0.92% at December 31, 2018, in line with expectations. Net charge- offs increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 when compared with the same period in the prior year primarily due to loan growth. Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until charged off. However, the Firm establishes an allowance, which is offset against loans and reduces interest income, for the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed interest and fee income. Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans For information on the geographic and FICO composition of the Firm’s credit card loans, refer to Note 11. Modifications of credit card loans At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Firm had $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, of credit card loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs. For additional information about loan modification programs to borrowers, refer to Note 11. 60 WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market- making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The credit performance of the wholesale portfolio remained favorable for the six months ended June 30, 2019, characterized by continued low levels of criticized exposure, nonaccrual loans and charge-offs. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 62–64 for further information. Loans held-for-sale decreased, driven by a loan syndication in CIB. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations. In the following tables, the Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, and excludes all exposure managed by CCB.

(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown is based on the ratings of the reference entity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used in credit portfolio management activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. (d) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is based on the remaining contractual maturity. Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at June 30, 2019, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or changes in market conditions. 62 Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to industries with actual or potential credit concerns. Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. The total criticized component of the portfolio, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was approximately $12 billion at both June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018. Below are summaries of the Firm’s exposures as of June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018. The industry of risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity.

The following table presents the change in the nonaccrual loan portfolio for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. Wholesale nonaccrual loan activity Six months ended June 30, (in millions) 2019 2018 Beginning balance $ 1,370 $ 1,734 Additions 1,201 505 Reductions: Paydowns and other 738 394 Gross charge-offs 143 231 Returned to performing status 25 176 Sales 57 107 Total reductions 963 908 Net changes 238 (403) Ending balance $ 1,608 $ 1,331 The following table presents net charge-offs/recoveries, which are defined as gross charge-offs less recoveries, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. The amounts in the table below do not include gains or losses from sales of nonaccrual loans. Wholesale net charge-offs/ (recoveries) (in millions, except ratios) Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Loans – reported Average loans retained $ 434,905 $ 414,980 $ 434,783 $ 409,949 Gross charge- offs 98 176 150 241 Gross recoveries (14) (30) (22) (76) Net charge- offs/ (recoveries) 84 146 128 165 Net charge- off/ (recovery) rate 0.08% 0.14% 0.06% 0.08% 65 Lending-related commitments The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these commitments or the Firm fulfill its obligations under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees are refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expire without being drawn upon or a default occurring. In the Firm’s view, the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is not representative of the Firm’s expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. For further information on wholesale lending-related commitments, refer to Note 22 . Derivative contracts Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risks including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange, equities, and commodities. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit and other market risk exposure. For a further discussion of derivative contracts, refer to Note 4. The following table summarizes the net derivative receivables for the periods presented. Derivative receivables (in millions) June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Total, net of cash collateral 52,878 54,213 Liquid securities and other cash collateral held against derivative receivables(a) (14,676) (15,322) Total, net of collateral $ 38,202 $ 38,891 (a) Includes collateral related to derivative instruments where appropriate legal opinions have not been either sought or obtained with respect to master netting agreements. The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance sheets were $52.9 billion and $54.2 billion at June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the Firm. However, in management’s view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid securities (primarily U.S. government and agency securities and other group of seven nations (“G7”) government securities) and other cash collateral held by the Firm aggregating $14.7 billion and $15.3 billion at June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively, that may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. In addition to the collateral described in the preceding paragraph, the Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 government securities, other liquid government-agency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the table above, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts move in the Firm’s favor. The derivative receivables fair value, net of all collateral, also does not include other credit enhancements, such as letters of credit. For additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements, refer to Note 4. 66 The following table summarizes the ratings profile of the Firm’s derivative receivables, including credit derivatives, net of all collateral, at the dates indicated. The ratings scale is based on the Firm’s internal ratings, which generally correspond to the ratings as assigned by S&P and Moody’s. Ratings profile of derivative receivables Rating equivalent June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 (in millions, except ratios) Exposure net of all collateral % of exposure net of all collateral Exposure net of all collateral % of exposure net of all collateral AAA/Aaa to AA-/Aa3 $ 10,435 27% $ 11,831 31% A+/A1 to A-/A3 5,154 13 7,428 19 BBB+/Baa1 to BBB-/Baa3 15,367 41 12,536 32 BB+/Ba1 to B-/B3 6,674 17 6,373 16 CCC+/Caa1 and below 572 2 723 2 Total $ 38,202 100% $ 38,891 100% As previously noted, the Firm uses collateral agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. The percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter derivative contracts subject to collateral agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily — was approximately 90% at both June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018. Credit derivatives The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated with various exposures. Credit portfolio management activities Included in the Firm’s end-user activities are credit derivatives used to mitigate the credit risk associated with traditional lending activities (loans and unfunded commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the Firm’s wholesale businesses (collectively, “credit portfolio management” activities). Information on credit portfolio management activities is provided in the table below. Credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities Notional amount of protection purchased and sold(a) (in millions) June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Credit derivatives used to manage: Loans and lending-related commitments $ 1,819 $ 1,272 Derivative receivables 13,473 11,410 Credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities $ 15,292 $ 12,682 (a) Amounts are presented net, considering the Firm’s net protection purchased or sold with respect to each underlying reference entity or index. For further information on credit derivatives and derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities, refer to Credit derivatives in Note 4 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. 67 ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES The Firm’s allowance for credit losses covers the retained consumer and wholesale loan portfolios, as well as the Firm’s wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments. For further information on the components of the allowance for credit losses and related management judgments, refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 76–77 and Note 12 of this Form 10-Q, and Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 141-143 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the Firm. As of June 30, 2019, JPMorgan Chase deemed the allowance for credit losses to be appropriate and sufficient to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio. The allowance for credit losses decreased compared with December 31, 2018, largely driven by Consumer due to a $400 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses in the PCI residential real estate portfolio, reflecting continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies, partially offset by a $200 million addition to the allowance in the credit card portfolio, due to loan growth and higher loss rates, as anticipated. For additional information on the consumer and wholesale credit portfolios, refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 55–59, Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 60–66 and Note 11. 68 Summary of changes in the allowance for credit losses 2019 2018 Six months ended June 30, Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale Total Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale Total(in millions, except ratios) Allowance for loan losses Beginning balance at January 1, $ 4,146 $ 5,184 $ 4,115 $ 13,445 $ 4,579 $ 4,884 $ 4,141 $ 13,604 Gross charge-offs 471 2,725 150 3,346 539 2,578 241 3,358 Gross recoveries (277) (283) (22) (582) (451) (244) (76) (771) Net charge-offs 194 2,442 128 2,764 88 2,334 165 2,587 Write-offs of PCI loans(a) 89 — — 89 93 — — 93 Provision for loan losses (204) 2,642 131 2,569 90 2,334 (98) 2,326 Other — (1) 6 5 — — — — Ending balance at June 30, $ 3,659 $ 5,383 $ 4,124 $ 13,166 $ 4,488 $ 4,884 $ 3,878 $ 13,250 Impairment methodology Asset-specific(b) $ 145 $ 472 $ 288 $ 905 $ 226 $ 402 $ 318 $ 946 Formula-based 2,215 4,911 3,836 10,962 2,130 4,482 3,560 10,172 PCI 1,299 — — 1,299 2,132 — — 2,132 Total allowance for loan losses $ 3,659 $ 5,383 $ 4,124 $ 13,166 $ 4,488 $ 4,884 $ 3,878 $ 13,250 Allowance for lending-related commitments Beginning balance at January 1, $ 33 $ — $ 1,022 $ 1,055 $ 33 $ — $ 1,035 $ 1,068 Provision for lending-related commitments — — 75 75 — — 49 49 Other — — (1) (1) — — — — Ending balance at June 30, $ 33 $ — $ 1,096 $ 1,129 $ 33 $ — $ 1,084 $ 1,117 Impairment methodology Asset-specific $ — $ — $ 136 $ 136 $ — $ — $ 139 $ 139 Formula-based 33 — 960 993 33 — 945 978 Total allowance for lending-related commitments(c) $ 33 $ — $ 1,096 $ 1,129 $ 33 $ — $ 1,084 $ 1,117 Total allowance for credit losses $ 3,692 $ 5,383 $ 5,220 $ 14,295 $ 4,521 $ 4,884 $ 4,962 $ 14,367 Memo: Retained loans, end of period $351,692 $ 157,568 $ 438,468 $947,728 $374,587 $145,221 $ 420,632 $940,440 Retained loans, average 363,634 152,435 434,783 950,852 373,562 142,757 409,949 926,268 PCI loans, end of period 22,242 — — 22,242 26,977 — 3 26,980 Credit ratios Allowance for loan losses to retained loans 1.04% 3.42% 0.94% 1.39% 1.20% 3.36% 0.92% 1.41% Allowance for loan losses to retained nonaccrual loans(d) 113 NM 333 295 113 NM 335 258 Allowance for loan losses to retained nonaccrual loans excluding credit card 113 NM 333 174 113 NM 335 163 Net charge-off rates 0.11 3.23 0.06 0.59 0.05 3.30 0.08 0.56 Credit ratios, excluding residential real estate PCI loans Allowance for loan losses to retained loans 0.72 3.42 0.94 1.28 0.68 3.36 0.92 1.22 Allowance for loan losses to retained nonaccrual loans(d) 73 NM 333 266 59 NM 335 217 Allowance for loan losses to retained nonaccrual loans excluding credit card 73 NM 333 145 59 NM 335 121 Net charge-off rates 0.11% 3.23% 0.06% 0.60% 0.05% 3.30% 0.08% 0.58% Note: In the table above, the financial measures which exclude the impact of PCI loans are non-GAAP financial measures. (a) Write-offs of PCI loans are recorded against the allowance for loan losses when actual losses for a pool exceed estimated losses that were recorded as purchase accounting adjustments at the time of acquisition. A write-off of a PCI loan is recognized when the underlying loan is removed from a pool. (b) Includes risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and loans that have been modified in a TDR. The asset-specific credit card allowance for loan losses modified in a TDR is calculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty rates. (c) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. (d) The Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance. 69 INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments arising from the investment securities portfolio held predominantly by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm’s balance sheet or asset-liability management objectives or from principal investments managed in the LOBs and Corporate in predominantly privately-held financial instruments. Investments are typically intended to be held over extended periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term realized gains with respect to these investments. Investment securities risk Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This risk is mitigated given that Treasury and CIO substantially invest in high-quality securities. At June 30, 2019, the investment securities portfolio was $305.4 billion, and the average credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available and where not available, based primarily upon internal ratings that correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody’s). For further information on the investment securities portfolio, refer to Corporate segment results on pages 41–42 and Note 9. For further information on the market risk inherent in the portfolio, refer to Market Risk Management on pages 70–74. For further information on related liquidity risk, refer to Liquidity Risk on pages 49– 53. Principal investment risk Principal investments are typically private non-traded financial instruments representing ownership or other forms of junior capital. Principal investments cover multiple asset classes and are made either in stand-alone investing businesses or as part of a broader business platform. In general, new principal investments include tax-oriented investments, as well as investments made to enhance or accelerate LOB and Corporate strategic business initiatives. The Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and are reflected within their respective financial results. As of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the aggregate carrying values of the principal investment portfolios were $22.0 billion and $22.2 billion, respectively, which included tax-oriented investments (e.g., affordable housing and alternative energy investments) of $16.0 billion and $16.6 billion, respectively, and private equity, various debt and equity instruments, and real assets of $6.0 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively. For a discussion of the Firm’s Investment Portfolio Risk Management governance and oversight, refer to page 123 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. 70 MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term. For a discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk Management organization, market risk measurement, risk monitoring and control, and predominant business activities that give rise to market risk, refer to Market Risk Management on pages 124–131 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Value-at-risk JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in the current market environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management decisions made by the lines of business and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures, provides the appropriate information needed to respond to risk events. The Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III. The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. For information regarding model reviews and approvals, refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 140 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. For further information regarding VaR, including the inherent limitations, and the key differences between Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR, refer to page 126 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. For additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR- based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and the respective backtesting), refer to JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website at: (http://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/ basel.cfm). For further information regarding nonstatistical market risk measures used by the Firm, refer to Other risk measures on pages 129-131 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. 71 The table below shows the results of the Firm’s Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level. VaR can vary significantly as positions change, market volatility fluctuates, and diversification benefits change. Total VaR Three months ended June 30, 2019 March 31, 2019 June 30, 2018 (in millions) Avg. Min Max Avg. Min Max Avg.

The diversification effect reflects that the risks are not perfectly correlated. (b) Diversification benefit represents the difference between the total VaR and each reported level and the sum of its individual components. Diversification benefit reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across lines of business, Corporate, and risk types. The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components and consequently diversification benefit is not meaningful. Quarter over quarter results Average total VaR decreased by $6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 as compared with the prior quarter. This reflects a reduction in risk across Fixed Income and Foreign Exchange risk types, partially offset by Equities risk type, driven by the inclusion of a CIB strategic investment in Tradeweb following the IPO in the second quarter of 2019. Year over year results Average total VaR increased by $11 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared with the same period in the prior year. The increase in average total VaR is primarily due to the Equities risk type, driven by the inclusion of a CIB strategic investment in Tradeweb following the IPO in the second quarter of 2019, changes in the risk profile for Fixed Income risk type and increased volatility. 72 VaR back-testing The Firm performs daily VaR model back-testing, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains and losses actually recognized on market-risk related revenue. The Firm’s definition of market risk-related gains and losses is consistent with the definition used by the banking regulators under Basel III. Under this definition market risk-related gains and losses are defined as: gains and losses on the positions included in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR excluding fees, commissions, certain valuation adjustments, net interest income, and gains and losses arising from intraday trading. The following chart compares actual daily market risk-related gains and losses with the Firm’s Risk Management VaR for the six months ended June 30, 2019. As the chart presents market risk-related gains and losses related to those positions included in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR, the results in the table below differ from the results of back-testing disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to CIB’s covered positions. The chart shows that for the six months ended June 30, 2019, the Firm observed two VaR back-testing exceptions and posted market risk-related gains on 82 of the 128 days. The Firm observed one VaR back-testing exception and posted market risk-related gains on 37 of the 65 days for the three months ended June 30, 2019. Daily Market Risk-Related Gains and Losses vs. Risk Management VaR (1-day, 95% Confidence level) Six months ended June 30, 2019 Market Risk-Related Gains and Losses Risk Management VaR January February March April May June 73 Earnings-at-risk The VaR and sensitivity measures illustrate the economic sensitivity of the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets to changes in market variables. The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported net income is also important as interest rate risk represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits and issuing debt as well as from the investment securities portfolio. One way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk exposure is through earnings-at-risk, which estimates the sensitivity of the Firm’s net interest income and interest rate-sensitive fees to changes in rates. For a summary by line of business and Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk, refer to the table on page 125 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. The Firm generates a baseline for net interest income and certain interest rate-sensitive fees, and then conducts simulations of changes for interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). This simulation primarily includes retained loans, deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and excludes other positions in risk management VaR and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page 125 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change in this baseline, over the following 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates constant and increasing long-term rates or decreasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates constant; and a flatter yield curve involving holding short-term rates constant and decreasing long-term rates or increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates constant. These scenarios consider the impact on exposures as a result of changes in interest rates from baseline rates, as well as pricing sensitivities of deposits, optionality and changes in product mix. The scenarios include forecasted balance sheet changes, as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but do not include assumptions about actions that could be taken by the Firm in response to any such instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience. The pricing sensitivity of deposits in the baseline and scenarios use assumed rates paid which may differ from actual rates paid due to timing lags and other factors. The Firm’s earnings-at- risk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and other factors. The Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below. (in billions) June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Parallel shift: +100 bps shift in rates $ 1.1 $ 0.9 -100 bps shift in rates (2.7) (2.1) Steeper yield curve: +100 bps shift in long-term rates 0.8 0.5 -100 bps shift in short-term rates (1.2) (1.2) Flatter yield curve: +100 bps shift in short-term rates 0.3 0.4 -100 bps shift in long-term rates (1.5) (0.9) The Firm’s sensitivity to rates is largely a result of assets repricing at a faster pace than deposits. The Firm’s net U.S. dollar parallel sensitivities as of June 30, 2019 increased when compared to December 31, 2018 primarily as a result of updating the Firm’s baseline to reflect lower interest rates largely offset by impacts from a net change in the Firm’s spot and forecasted balance sheet. The Firm’s non-U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below. (in billions) June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Parallel shift: +100 bps shift in rates $ 0.6 $ 0.5 Flatter yield curve: +100 bps shift in short-term rates 0.6 0.5 The results of the non-U.S. dollar interest rate scenario involving a steeper yield curve with long-term rates rising by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at current levels were not material to the Firm’s earnings-at-risk at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. 74 Other sensitivity-based measures The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain investment and funding activities by assessing the potential impact on net revenue and OCI due to changes in relevant market variables. For additional information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures, refer to the table Predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on page 125 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue or OCI for market risk-sensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging purposes are reported along with the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, as the movement in market parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future deterioration in these sensitivities.

(b) Impact recognized through OCI. 75 COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT The Firm, through its lines of business and Corporate, may be exposed to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political or other significant developments which adversely affect the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country. For a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk management, refer to pages 132–133 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of June 30, 2019 and their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2018. The selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total exposures by country, based on the Firm’s internal country risk management approach, and does not represent the Firm’s view of any actual or potentially adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to client activity and market flows. The increase in exposure to Japan is predominantly due to increased cash balances placed with the central bank of Japan, driven by client activity.

The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. The methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments. Allowance for credit losses The Firm’s allowance for credit losses covers the retained consumer and wholesale loan portfolios, as well as the Firm’s wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments. The allowance for loan losses is intended to adjust the carrying value of the Firm’s loan assets to reflect probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Similarly, the allowance for lending- related commitments is established to cover probable credit losses inherent in the lending-related commitments portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The allowance for credit losses includes a formula-based component, an asset-specific component, and a component related to PCI loans. The determination of each of these components involves significant judgment on a number of matters. For further information on these components, areas of judgment and methodologies used in establishing the Firm’s allowance for credit losses, refer to pages 120– 122, page 141 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K; and refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 67–68 and Note 12 of this Form 10-Q. As noted in the discussion on page 141 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K, the Firm’s allowance for credit losses is sensitive to numerous factors, which may differ depending on the portfolio. Changes in economic conditions or in the Firm’s assumptions and estimates could affect its estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. The Firm uses its best judgment to assess these economic conditions and loss data in estimating the allowance for credit losses and these estimates are subject to periodic refinement based on changes to underlying external or Firm-specific historical data. For further information, refer to Note 12. To illustrate the potential magnitude of certain alternate judgments, the Firm estimates that changes in the following inputs would have the following effects on the Firm’s modeled credit loss estimates as of June 30, 2019, without consideration of any offsetting or correlated effects of other inputs in the Firm’s allowance for loan losses: • A combined 5% decline in housing prices and a 100 basis point increase in unemployment rates from expectations could imply: an increase to modeled credit loss estimates of approximately $250 million for PCI loans. an increase to modeled annual credit loss estimates of approximately $50 million for residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans. • For credit card loans, a 100 basis point increase in unemployment rates from expectations could imply an increase to modeled annual credit loss estimates of approximately $800 million. • An increase in probability of default (“PD”) factors consistent with a one-notch downgrade in the Firm’s internal risk ratings for its entire wholesale loan portfolio could imply an increase in the Firm’s modeled credit loss estimates of approximately $1.7 billion. • A 100 basis point increase in estimated loss given default (“LGD”) for the Firm’s entire wholesale loan portfolio could imply an increase in the Firm’s modeled credit loss estimates of approximately $175 million. The purpose of these sensitivity analyses is to provide an indication of the isolated impacts of hypothetical alternative assumptions on modeled loss estimates. The changes in the inputs presented above are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future deterioration of those risk factors. In addition, these analyses are not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for loan losses, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and conditions. It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in specific factors might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in these factors and inputs may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in other factors. In addition, it is difficult to predict how changes in specific economic conditions or assumptions could affect borrower behavior or other factors considered by management in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Given the process the Firm follows and the judgments made in evaluating the risk factors related to its loss estimates, management believes that its current estimate of the allowance for credit losses is appropriate. 77 Fair value Assets measured at fair value The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. For further information, refer to Note 2. June 30, 2019 (in billions, except ratios) Total assets at fair value Total level 3 assets Trading–debt and equity instruments $ 470.4 $ 4.4 Derivative receivables(a) 52.9 6.2 Trading assets 523.3 10.6 AFS securities 276.4 — Loans 4.3 — MSRs 5.1 5.1 Other 28.5 0.8 Total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis $ 837.6 $ 16.5 Total assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 1.6 0.9 Total assets measured at fair value $ 839.2 $ 17.4 Total Firm assets $ 2,727.4 Level 3 assets as a percentage of total Firm assets(a) 0.6% Level 3 assets as a percentage of total Firm assets at fair value(a) 2.1% (a) For purposes of the table above, the derivative receivables total reflects the impact of netting adjustments; however, the $6.2 billion of derivative receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral. Valuation Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2. In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess all relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment rates, default rates, volatilities, correlations, equity or debt prices, valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. For a further discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs used, refer to Note 2. For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole. For a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm refer to Note 2. Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. For a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments, refer to Note 2. Goodwill impairment Management applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the related reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. For a description of the significant valuation judgments associated with goodwill impairment, refer to Goodwill impairment on page 142 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. For additional information on goodwill, including the goodwill impairment assessment as of June 30, 2019, refer to Note 14. Credit card rewards liability The credit card rewards liability was $6.0 billion and $5.8 billion at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. For a description of the significant assumptions and judgments associated with the Firm’s credit card rewards liability, refer to page 143 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Income taxes For a description of the significant assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with the accounting for income taxes, refer to Income taxes on page 143 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Litigation reserves For a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing litigation reserves, refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. 78 ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Standards Adopted January 1, 2019 Standard Summary of guidance Effects on financial statements Leases Issued February 2016 • Requires lessees to recognize all leases longer than twelve months on the Consolidated balance sheets as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use asset. • Requires lessees and lessors to classify most leases using principles similar to existing lease accounting, but eliminates the “bright line” classification tests. • Expands qualitative and quantitative leasing disclosures. • Adopted January 1, 2019. • The Firm elected the available practical expedient to not reassess whether existing contracts contain a lease or whether classification or unamortized initial lease costs would be different under the new lease guidance. The Firm elected the modified retrospective transition method, through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings without revising prior periods. • For further information, refer to Note 16. FASB Standards Issued but not yet Adopted Standard Summary of guidance Effects on financial statements Financial instruments – credit losses Issued June 2016 • Replaces existing incurred loss impairment guidance and establishes a single allowance framework for financial assets carried at amortized cost, which will reflect management’s estimate of credit losses over the full remaining expected life of the financial assets and will consider expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. • Eliminates existing guidance for PCI loans, and requires recognition of the nonaccretable difference as an increase to the allowance for expected credit losses on financial assets purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination, which will be offset by an increase in the recorded investment of the related loans. • Requires inclusion of expected recoveries, limited to the cumulative amount of prior write-offs, when estimating the allowance for credit losses for in scope financial assets (including collateral dependent assets). • Amends existing impairment guidance for AFS securities to incorporate an allowance, which will allow for reversals of credit impairments in the event that the credit of an issuer improves. • Requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the reporting period of adoption. • Required effective date: January 1, 2020.(a) • The Firm has established a Firmwide, cross-discipline governance structure, which provides implementation oversight. The Firm continues to test and refine its current expected credit loss models that satisfy the requirements of the new standard. Oversight and testing, as well as efforts to meet expanded disclosure requirements, will extend through the remainder of 2019. • The Firm expects that the allowance related to the Firm’s loans and commitments will increase as it will cover credit losses over the full remaining expected life of the portfolios. The Firm currently intends to estimate losses over a two-year forecast period using the weighted-average of a range of macroeconomic scenarios (established on a Firmwide basis), and then revert to longer term historical loss experience to estimate losses over more extended periods. • The Firm currently expects the increase in the allowance to be in the range of $4-6 billion, primarily driven by Card. This estimate is subject to further refinement based on continuing reviews and approvals of models, methodologies and judgments. The ultimate impact will depend upon the nature and characteristics of the Firm’s portfolio at the adoption date, the macroeconomic conditions and forecasts at that date, and other management judgments. • The Firm plans to adopt the new guidance on January 1, 2020. Goodwill Issued January 2017 • Requires an impairment loss to be recognized when the estimated fair value of a reporting unit falls below its carrying value. • Eliminates the second condition in the current guidance that requires an impairment loss to be recognized only if the estimated implied fair value of the goodwill is below its carrying value. • Required effective date: January 1, 2020.(a) • Based on current impairment test results, the Firm does not expect a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the impact of the new accounting guidance will depend on the performance of the reporting units and the market conditions at the time of adoption. • After adoption, the guidance may result in more frequent goodwill impairment losses due to the removal of the second condition. • The Firm plans to adopt the new guidance on January 1, 2020. (a) Early adoption is permitted. 79 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS From time to time, the Firm has made and will make forward-looking statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) Note 1 – Basis of presentation JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or “the Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest banking institutions in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. For a further discussion of the Firm’s business segments, refer to Note 25. The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included such that this interim financial information is fairly presented. These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation. Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity. For a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies regarding consolidation, refer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Offsetting assets and liabilities U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities financing activities to be presented on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances when the specified conditions are met. For further information on offsetting assets and liabilities, refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Income tax expense The Firm’s effective tax rate was 14.9% and 16.6% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, and 21.3% and 19.8% in the respective 2018 periods. The effective tax rate reflects the recognition of tax benefits related to the resolution of certain tax audits of $768 million and $874 million, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, which reduced the Firm’s effective tax rate by 6.8% and 3.9% respectively. For further information, refer to Note 24 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Note 2 – Fair value measurement For a discussion of the Firm’s valuation methodologies for assets, liabilities and lending-related commitments measured at fair value and the fair value hierarchy, refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. 86 The following table presents the assets and liabilities reported at fair value as of June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, by major product category and fair value hierarchy.

(c) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities 88 inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. For a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships, refer to Note 4. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented. (d) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions). (e) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $746 million and $747 million, respectively. Included in these balances at June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, were trading assets of $45 million and $49 million, respectively, and other assets of $701 million and $698 million, respectively. (f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral. Level 3 valuations For further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments, refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and, for certain instruments, the weighted averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/ or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/ instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range and the weighted average value do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to- period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date. For the Firm’s derivatives and structured notes positions classified within level 3 at June 30, 2019, interest rate correlation inputs used in estimating fair value were concentrated towards the upper end of the range; equity correlation, equity-FX, and equity-IR correlation inputs were concentrated in the middle of the range; commodity correlation inputs were concentrated in the middle of the range; credit correlation inputs were concentrated towards the lower end of the range; and the interest rate-foreign exchange (“IR-FX”) correlation inputs were distributed across the range. In addition, the interest rate spread volatility inputs used in estimating fair value were distributed across the range; equity volatilities and commodity volatilities were concentrated towards the lower end of the range; and forward commodity prices used in estimating the fair value of commodity derivatives were concentrated in the middle of the range. Prepayment speed inputs used in estimating the fair value of interest rate derivatives were concentrated towards the lower end of the range. Recovery rate inputs used in estimating the fair value of credit derivatives were distributed across the range; credit spreads and conditional default rates were concentrated towards the lower end of the range; loss severity inputs were concentrated towards the upper end of the range and price inputs were concentrated towards the lower end of the range. 89 Level 3 inputs(a) June 30, 2019 Product/Instrument Fair value (in millions) Principal valuation technique Unobservable inputs(g) Range of input values Weighted average Residential mortgage-backed securities and loans(b) $ 942 Discounted cash flows Yield 0% – 15% 6% Prepayment speed 0% – 26% 13% Conditional default rate 0% – 5% 1% Loss severity 0% – 70% 1% Commercial mortgage-backed securities and loans(c) 218 Market comparables Price $ 0 – $ 110 $ 85 Obligations of U.S. states and municipalities 680 Market comparables Price $ 66 – $ 100 $ 97 Corporate debt securities 562 Market comparables Price $ 0 – $ 109 $ 83 Loans(d) 212 Discounted cash flows Yield 5% – 18% 7% 1,079 Market comparables Price $ 2 – $ 102 $ 80 Asset-backed securities 33 Market comparables Price $ 1 – $ 100 $ 38 Net interest rate derivatives (616) Option pricing Interest rate spread volatility 20 bps – 30 bps Interest rate correlation (28)% – 96% IR-FX correlation 45% – 60% 72 Discounted cash flows Prepayment speed 4% – 30% Net credit derivatives (265) Discounted cash flows Credit correlation 35% – 60% Credit spread 6 bps – 1,402 bps Recovery rate 20% – 70% Conditional default rate 2% – 91% Loss severity 100% 33 Market comparables Price $ 1 – $ 115 Net foreign exchange derivatives (23) Option pricing IR-FX correlation (45)% – 60% (170) Discounted cash flows Prepayment speed 9% Net equity derivatives (2,560) Option pricing Equity volatility 14% – 60% Equity correlation 25% – 98% Equity-FX correlation (75)% – 59% Equity-IR correlation 20% – 60% Net commodity derivatives (908) Option pricing Forward commodity price $ 49 – $ 70 per barrel Commodity volatility 5% – 65% Commodity correlation (48)% – 95% MSRs 5,093 Discounted cash flows Refer to Note 14 Other assets 358 Discounted cash flows Credit spread 45 bps 45 bps Yield 8% – 12% 12% 814 Market comparables Price $ 19 – $ 113 $ 34 Long-term debt, short-term borrowings, and deposits(e) 27,981 Option pricing Interest rate spread volatility 20 bps – 30 bps Interest rate correlation (28)% – 96% IR-FX correlation (45)% – 60% Equity correlation 25% – 98% Equity-FX correlation (75)% – 59% Equity-IR correlation 20% – 60% Other level 3 assets and liabilities, net(f) 200 (a) The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from their classification on the Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the technique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ. (b) Comprises U.S. government agency securities of $617 million, nonagency securities of $42 million and trading loans of $283 million. (c) Comprises nonagency securities of $9 million, trading loans of $204 million and non-trading loans of $5 million. (d) Comprises trading loans. (e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are financial instruments that typically contain embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables. (f) Includes level 3 assets and liabilities that are insignificant both individually and in aggregate. (g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of $100. 90 Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs For a discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in unobservable inputs and the relationships between unobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements The following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments. 91 Fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs Three months ended June 30, 2019 (in millions) Fair value at April 1, 2019 Total realized/ unrealized gains/

(i) The prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. (j) Realized gains/(losses) on AFS securities, as well as other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) losses that are recorded in earnings, are reported in investment securities gains/(losses). Unrealized gains/(losses) are reported in OCI. There were no realized gains/(losses) recorded in income on AFS securities for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Unrealized gains/(losses) recorded on AFS securities in OCI were zero for both the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively and zero and $1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Level 3 analysis Consolidated balance sheets changes Level 3 assets, including assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, were 0.6% of total Firm assets at June 30, 2019. The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets since December 31, 2018, for those items measured at fair value on a recurring basis. For further information on changes impacting items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, refer to Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 96. Three and six months ended June 30, 2019 Level 3 assets were $16.5 billion at June 30, 2019, reflecting a decrease of $553 million and $622 million from March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The decrease for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 was driven by a reduction of approximately $1.0 billion in MSRs. For additional information, refer to the Gains and losses section below. Transfers between levels for instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis For both the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 there were no individually significant transfers. All transfers are based on changes in the observability and/or significance of the valuation inputs and are assumed to occur at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period in which they occur. Gains and losses The following describes significant components of total realized/unrealized gains/(losses) for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the periods indicated. These amounts exclude any effects of the Firm’s risk management activities where the financial instruments are classified as level 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. For further information on these instruments, refer to Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements rollforward tables on pages 90–95. Three months ended June 30, 2019 • $1.5 billion of net losses on assets, driven by derivative receivables due to market movements and MSRs reflecting updates to model inputs and faster prepayment speeds on lower rates. • $615 million of net losses on liabilities, largely due to market movements in long-term debt. Three months ended June 30, 2018 • $278 million of net gains on assets and $504 million of net gains on liabilities, none of which were individually significant. Six months ended June 30, 2019 • $1.0 billion of net losses on assets, predominantly driven by MSRs reflecting updates to model inputs and faster prepayment speeds on lower rates. • $2.1 billion of net losses on liabilities, predominantly driven by market movements in long-term debt. Six months ended June 30, 2018 • $1.7 billion of net gains on assets predominantly driven by market movements in derivative receivables, in particular equity derivative receivables. • $822 million of net gains on liabilities, none of which were individually significant. Credit and funding adjustments — derivatives The following table provides the impact of credit and funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue in the respective periods, excluding the effect of any associated hedging activities. The FVA presented below includes the impact of the Firm’s own credit quality on the inception value of liabilities as well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s own credit quality over time.

Fair value hierarchy Total fair valueJune 30, 2019 (in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Loans $ — $ 733 $ 141 (b) $ 874 Other assets(a) — 13 713 726 Total assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis $ — $ 746 $ 854 $ 1,600 Fair value hierarchy Total fair valueJune 30, 2018 (in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Loans $ — $ 325 $ 210 $ 535 Other assets — 217 823 1,040 Total assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis $ — $ 542 $ 1,033 $ 1,575 (a) Primarily includes equity securities without readily determinable fair values that were adjusted based on observable price changes in orderly transactions from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (measurement alternative). Of the $713 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of June 30, 2019, $564 million related to such equity securities. These equity securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the shares. (b) Of the $141 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of June 30, 2019, $110 million related to residential real estate loans carried at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (e.g., collateral-dependent loans and other loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance). These amounts are classified as level 3 as they are valued using information from broker’s price opinions, appraisals and automated valuation models and discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts ranged from 14% to 49% with a weighted average of 29%. There were no material liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at June 30, 2019 and 2018. Nonrecurring fair value changes The following table presents the total change in value of assets and liabilities for which a fair value adjustment has been recognized for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, related to assets and liabilities held at those dates. Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, (in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Loans $ (33) $ (18) $ (54) $ (22) Other assets(a) 13 37 90 528 Total nonrecurring fair value gains/(losses) $ (20) $ 19 $ 36 $ 506 (a) Included $16 million and $41 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively and $95 million and $534 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, of net gains as a result of the measurement alternative. For further information about the measurement of impaired collateral-dependent loans, and other loans where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral (e.g., residential mortgage loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance), refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. 97 Equity securities without readily determinable fair values The Firm measures equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer, with such changes recognized in earnings. In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the Firm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments. The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values still held as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

(c) The cumulative downward carrying value changes/impairment between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2019 were $(202) million. Included in other assets above is the Firm’s interest in approximately 40 million Visa Class B shares, recorded at a nominal carrying value. These shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions currently and will be convertible into Visa Class A shares upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. The conversion rate of Visa Class B shares into Visa Class A shares is 1.6298 at June 30, 2019, and may be adjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters. 98 Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value The following table presents by fair value hierarchy classification the carrying values and estimated fair values at June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, of financial assets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, and their classification within the fair value hierarchy.

For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a financial asset or liability is the result of the different methodologies used to determine fair value as compared with carrying value. For example, credit losses are estimated for a financial asset’s remaining life in a fair value calculation but are estimated for a loss emergence period in the allowance for loan loss calculation; future loan income (interest and fees) is incorporated in a fair value calculation but is generally not considered in the allowance for loan losses. The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value of the wholesale allowance for lending-related commitments and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related commitments were as follows for the periods indicated. June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Estimated fair value hierarchy Estimated fair value hierarchy (in billions) Carrying value(a) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total estimated fair value Carrying value(a) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total estimated fair value(b) Wholesale lending- related commitments $ 1.1 $ — $ — $ 1.8 $ 1.8 $ 1.0 $ — $ — $ 1.9 $ 1.9 (a) Excludes the current carrying values of the guarantee liability and the offsetting asset, each of which is recognized at fair value at the inception of the guarantees. (b) The prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer lending-related commitments. In many cases, the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. For a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related commitments, refer to page 161 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. 99 Note 3 – Fair value option For a discussion of the primary financial instruments for which the fair value option was elected, including the basis for those elections and the determination of instrument-specific credit risk, where relevant, refer to Note 3 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Changes in fair value under the fair value option election The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table.

Realized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk recorded in principal transactions revenue were not material for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. (b) Long-term debt measured at fair value predominantly relates to structured notes. Although the risk associated with the structured notes is actively managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not include the income statement impact of the risk management instruments used to manage such risk. (c) Reported in mortgage fees and related income. (d) Reported in other income. (e) Changes in fair value exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest expense for all instruments other than hybrid financial instruments. For further information regarding interest income and interest expense, refer to Note 6. 101 Difference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding The following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding as of June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, for loans, long-term debt and long-term beneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected.

(b) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal- protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes. (c) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date. At June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was elected was $9.7 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $(95) million and $(82) million, respectively. For further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K, and Note 22 of this Form 10-Q.

For a further discussion of the Firm’s use of and accounting policies regarding derivative instruments, refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge accounting relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are used to manage certain risks associated with specified assets or liabilities (“specified risk management” positions) as well as derivatives used in the Firm’s market-making businesses or for other purposes. The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure category.

Notional amounts(b) (in billions) June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Interest rate contracts Swaps $ 25,583 $ 21,763 Futures and forwards 4,600 3,562 Written options 4,572 3,997 Purchased options 5,054 4,322 Total interest rate contracts 39,809 33,644 Credit derivatives(a) 1,294 1,501 Foreign exchange contracts Cross-currency swaps 3,824 3,548 Spot, futures and forwards 6,951 5,871 Written options 922 835 Purchased options 939 830 Total foreign exchange contracts 12,636 11,084 Equity contracts Swaps 365 346 Futures and forwards 122 101 Written options 640 528 Purchased options 573 490 Total equity contracts 1,700 1,465 Commodity contracts Swaps 148 134 Spot, futures and forwards 161 156 Written options 143 135 Purchased options 126 120 Total commodity contracts 578 545 Total derivative notional amounts $ 56,017 $ 48,239 (a) For more information on volumes and types of credit derivative contracts, refer to the Credit derivatives discussion on page 112. (b) Represents the sum of gross long and gross short third-party notional derivative contracts. While the notional amounts disclosed above give an indication of the volume of the Firm’s derivatives activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed, in the Firm’s view, the possible losses that could arise from such transactions. For most derivative contracts, the notional amount is not exchanged; it is used simply as a reference to calculate payments. 104 Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated balance sheets The following table summarizes information on derivative receivables and payables (before and after netting adjustments) that are reflected on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, by accounting designation (e.g., whether the derivatives were designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships or not) and contract type.

Refer to Note 3 for further information. (b) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral receivables and payables when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. 105 Derivatives netting The following tables present, as of June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, gross and net derivative receivables and payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the same counterparty have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below. In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation: • collateral that consists of non-cash financial instruments (generally U.S. government and agency securities and other G7 government securities) and cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are shown separately as “Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure amount. • the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and • collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below.

(b) Represents liquid security collateral as well as cash collateral held at third-party custodians related to derivative instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has been obtained. For some counterparties, the collateral amounts of financial instruments may exceed the derivative receivables and derivative payables balances. Where this is the case, the total amount reported is limited to the net derivative receivables and net derivative payables balances with that counterparty. (c) Derivative collateral relates only to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments. (d) Net derivatives receivable included cash collateral netted of $65.0 billion and $55.2 billion at June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. Net derivatives payable included cash collateral netted of $53.3 billion and $43.3 billion at June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. Derivative cash collateral relates to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments. 107 Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features For a more detailed discussion of liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features related to the Firm’s derivative contracts, refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018. OTC and OTC-cleared derivative payables containing downgrade triggers (in millions) June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Aggregate fair value of net derivative payables $ 15,294 $ 9,396 Collateral posted 14,023 8,907 The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral, (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payments requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract. Liquidity impact of downgrade triggers on OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 (in millions) Single-notch downgrade Two-notch downgrade Single-notch downgrade Two-notch downgrade Amount of additional collateral to be posted upon downgrade(a) $ 180 $ 1,228 $ 76 $ 947 Amount required to settle contracts with termination triggers upon downgrade(b) 302 1,613 172 764 (a) Includes the additional collateral to be posted for initial margin. (b) Amounts represent fair values of derivative payables, and do not reflect collateral posted. Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 10, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding was not material at both June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. 108 Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated statements of income The following tables provide information related to gains and losses recorded on derivatives based on their hedge accounting designation or purpose. Fair value hedge gains and losses The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in fair value hedge accounting relationships, as well as pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives and the related hedged items for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Firm includes gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income as the related hedged item.

Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income. (b) Excludes the amortization expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item. This expense is recorded in net interest income and substantially offsets the income statement impact of the excluded components. Also excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items. (c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income. (d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. (e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis spreads. The initial amount of the excluded components may be amortized into income over the life of the derivative, or changes in fair value may be recognized in current period earnings. (f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly cross-currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative. 109 As of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets related to certain cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that are expected to reverse through the income statement in future periods as an adjustment to yield. Carrying amount of the hedged items(a)(b) Cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments included in the carrying amount of hedged items: June 30, 2019 (in millions) Active hedging relationships Discontinued hedging relationships(d) Total Assets Investment securities - AFS $ 91,668 (c) $ 2,084 $ 292 $ 2,376 Liabilities Long-term debt $ 151,184 $ 6,534 $ 55 $ 6,589 Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs 5,208 — (15) (15) Carrying amount of the hedged items(a)(b) Cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments included in the carrying amount of hedged items: December 31, 2018 (in millions) Active hedging relationships Discontinued hedging relationships(d) Total Assets Investment securities - AFS $ 55,313 (c) $ (1,105) $ 381 $ (724) Liabilities Long-term debt $ 139,915 $ 141 $ 8 $ 149 Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs 6,987 — (33) (33) (a) Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, to which the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Given the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income in future periods. (b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future periods. At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the carrying amount excluded for available-for-sale securities is $14.4 billion and $14.6 billion, respectively, and for long-term debt is $6.0 billion and $7.3 billion, respectively. (c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost. (d) Represents hedged items no longer designated in qualifying fair value hedging relationships for which an associated basis adjustment exists at the balance sheet date. 110 Cash flow hedge gains and losses The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Firm includes the gain/(loss) on the hedging derivative in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income as the change in cash flows on the related hedged item. Derivatives gains/(losses) recorded in income and other comprehensive income/(loss) Three months ended June 30, 2019 (in millions) Amounts reclassified from AOCI to income Amounts recorded in OCI Total change in OCI for period Contract type Interest rate(a) $ 2 $ 155 $ 153 Foreign exchange(b) (28) (54) (26) Total $ (26) $ 101 $ 127 Derivatives gains/(losses) recorded in income and other comprehensive income/(loss) Three months ended June 30, 2018 (in millions) Amounts reclassified from AOCI to income Amounts recorded in OCI Total change in OCI for period Contract type Interest rate(a) $ 13 $ (33) $ (46) Foreign exchange(b) 6 (166) (172) Total $ 19 $ (199) $ (218) Derivatives gains/(losses) recorded in income and other comprehensive income/(loss) Six months ended June 30, 2019 (in millions) Amounts reclassified from AOCI to income Amounts recorded in OCI Total change in OCI for period Contract type Interest rate(a) $ 4 $ 211 $ 207 Foreign exchange(b) (69) 31 100 Total $ (65) $ 242 $ 307 Derivatives gains/(losses) recorded in income and other comprehensive income/(loss) Six months ended June 30, 2018 (in millions) Amounts reclassified from AOCI to income Amounts recorded in OCI Total change in OCI for period Contract type Interest rate(a) $ 26 $ (111) $ (137) Foreign exchange(b) 45 (132) (177) Total $ 71 $ (243) $ (314) (a) Primarily consists of hedges of LIBOR-indexed floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income. (b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and compensation expense. The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $(53) million (after-tax) of net losses recorded in AOCI at June 30, 2019, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have been terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized in earnings is approximately six years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately seven years. The Firm’s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities. 111 Net investment hedge gains and losses The following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. Gains/(losses) recorded in income and other comprehensive income/(loss) 2019 2018 Three months ended June 30, (in millions) Amounts recorded in income(a)(b) Amounts recorded in OCI Amounts recorded in income(a)(b)(c) Amounts recorded in OCI Foreign exchange derivatives $ 27 $ (123) $ — $ 1,204 Gains/(losses) recorded in income and other comprehensive income/(loss) 2019 2018 Six months ended June 30, (in millions) Amounts recorded in income(a)(b) Amounts recorded in OCI Amounts recorded in income(a)(b)(c) Amounts recorded in OCI Foreign exchange derivatives $ 48 $ (161) $ (10) $ 815 (a) Certain components of hedging derivatives are permitted to be excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts.

Gains and losses were recorded predominantly in mortgage fees and related income. (b) Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate credit risk associated with lending exposures in the Firm’s wholesale businesses. These derivatives do not include credit derivatives used to mitigate counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables, which is included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. (c) Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. (d) The prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 5 for information on principal transactions revenue. 112 Credit derivatives For a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives, refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.

(b) Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is identical to the reference instrument on protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each individual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the notional amount of protection sold. (c) Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would generally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement value. (d) Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where the Firm has not sold any protection on the identical reference instrument. The following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of credit derivatives and credit-related notes as of June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of protection. The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives and credit-related notes where JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are comparable to the profile reflected below.

Further, the Firm did not recognize any credit-related OTTI losses during the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. Accordingly, the Firm believes that the investment securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI as of June 30, 2019, are not other-than-temporarily impaired.

The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. (b) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately 6 years for agency residential MBS, 3 years for agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and 3 years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations. 121 Note 10 – Securities financing activities For a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities financing activities, refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. For further information regarding securities borrowed and securities lending agreements for which the fair value option has been elected, refer to Note 3. For further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements, refer to Note 23. The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm’s securities financing agreements as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts” presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below.

These amounts are presented within accounts payable and other liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheets. (b) Includes securities financing agreements accounted for at fair value. At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, included securities purchased under resale agreements of $14.0 billion and $13.2 billion, respectively; securities sold under repurchase agreements of $981 million and $935 million, respectively; and securities borrowed of $5.7 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively. There were no securities loaned accounted for at fair value in either period. (c) In some cases, collateral exchanged with a counterparty exceeds the net asset or liability balance with that counterparty. In such cases, the amounts reported in this column are limited to the related net asset or liability with that counterparty. (d) Includes securities financing agreements that provide collateral rights, but where an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement has not been either sought or obtained. At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, included $9.6 billion and $7.9 billion, respectively, of securities purchased under resale agreements; $31.9 billion and $30.3 billion, respectively, of securities borrowed; $20.2 billion and $21.5 billion, respectively, of securities sold under repurchase agreements; and $18 million and $25 million, respectively, of securities loaned and other. 122 The tables below present as of June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018 the types of financial assets pledged in securities financing agreements and the remaining contractual maturity of the securities financing agreements.

These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated balance sheets. The prior period amount has been revised to conform with the current period presentation. 123 Note 11 – Loans Loan accounting framework The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan, and on whether the loan was credit- impaired at the date of acquisition. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories: • Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”), other than PCI loans • Loans held-for-sale • Loans at fair value • PCI loans held-for-investment For a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies, refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Refer to Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm’s elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 of this Form 10- Q for information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets. Loan portfolio The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class. Consumer, excluding credit card(a) Credit card Wholesale(f) Residential real estate – excluding PCI • Residential mortgage(b) • Home equity(c) Other consumer loans(d) • Auto • Consumer & Business Banking(e) Residential real estate – PCI • Home equity • Prime mortgage • Subprime mortgage • Option ARMs • Credit card loans • Commercial and industrial • Real estate • Financial institutions • Governments & Agencies • Other(g) (a) Includes loans held in CCB, prime mortgage and home equity loans held in AWM and prime mortgage loans held in Corporate. (b) Predominantly includes prime loans (including option ARMs). (c) Includes senior and junior lien home equity loans. (d) Includes certain business banking and auto dealer risk-rated loans that apply the wholesale methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses; these loans are managed by CCB, and therefore, for consistency in presentation, are included with the other consumer loan classes. (e) Predominantly includes Business Banking loans. (f) Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate. Excludes prime mortgage and home equity loans held in AWM and prime mortgage loans held in Corporate. Classes are internally defined and may not align with regulatory definitions. (g) Includes loans to: individuals and individual entities (predominantly consists of Wealth Management clients within AWM and includes exposure to personal investment companies and personal and testamentary trusts), SPEs and Private education and civic organizations. For more information on SPEs, refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. The following tables summarize the Firm’s loan balances by portfolio segment.

(b) Loans (other than PCI loans and loans for which the fair value option has been elected) are presented net of unamortized discounts and premiums and net deferred loan fees or costs. These amounts were not material as of June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018. 124 The following tables provide information about the carrying value of retained loans purchased, sold and reclassified to held- for-sale during the periods indicated. Reclassifications of loans to held-for sale are non-cash transactions. The Firm manages its exposure to credit risk on an ongoing basis. Selling loans is one way that the Firm reduces its credit exposures. Loans that were reclassified to held-for-sale and sold in a subsequent period are excluded from the sales line of this table. 2019 2018 Three months ended June 30, (in millions) Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale Total Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale Total Purchases $ 234 (a)(b) $ — $ 359 $ 593 $ 532 (a)(b) $ — $ 532 $ 1,064 Sales 6,856 — 5,400 12,256 2,391 — 4,943 7,334 Retained loans reclassified to held- for-sale 948 — 924 1,872 — — 392 392 2019 2018 Six months ended June 30, (in millions) Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale Total Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale Total Purchases $ 785 (a)(b) $ — $ 588 $ 1,373 $ 1,603 (a)(b) $ — $ 1,630 $ 3,233 Sales 15,514 — 10,845 26,359 2,872 — 8,632 11,504 Retained loans reclassified to held- for-sale 5,061 — 1,425 6,486 36 — 1,260 1,296 (a) Purchases predominantly represent the Firm’s voluntary repurchase of certain delinquent loans from loan pools as permitted by Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) guidelines. The Firm typically elects to repurchase these delinquent loans as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with applicable requirements of Ginnie Mae, FHA, RHS, and/or VA. (b) Excludes purchases of retained loans sourced through the correspondent origination channel and underwritten in accordance with the Firm’s standards. Such purchases were $4.3 billion and $5.3 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $7.5 billion and $8.9 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Gains and losses on sales of loans Gains and losses on sales of loans (including adjustments to record loans held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value) recognized in other income were not material to the Firm for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. In addition, the sale of loans may also result in write downs, recoveries or changes in the allowance recognized in the provision for credit losses. Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto loans and consumer and business banking loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period, and certain payment-option loans that may result in negative amortization. The following table provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class.

(b) At June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, residential mortgage loans excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $2.3 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. (c) These balances, which are 90 days or more past due, were excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed by U.S government agencies. Typically the principal balance of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, these balances included $623 million and $999 million, respectively, of loans that are no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing guidelines. For the remaining balance, interest is being accrued at the guaranteed reimbursement rate. There were no loans that were not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018. (d) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. These property values do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should be viewed as estimates. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. (e) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis. (f) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at June 30, 2019. (g) At June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $4.2 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively. These amounts have been excluded from the geographic regions presented based upon the government guarantee. 126 Approximately 37% of the home equity portfolio are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien HELOANs or HELOCs. The following table provides the Firm’s delinquency statistics for junior lien home equity loans and lines of credit as of June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018. Total loans Total 30+ day delinquency rate (in millions, except ratios) Jun 30, 2019 Dec 31, 2018 Jun 30, 2019 Dec 31, 2018 HELOCs:(a) Within the revolving period(b) $ 5,611 $ 5,608 0.32% 0.25% Beyond the revolving period 9,949 11,286 2.48 2.80 HELOANs 896 1,030 2.68 2.82 Total $ 16,456 $ 17,924 1.76% 2.00% (a) These HELOCs are predominantly revolving loans for a 10-year period, after which time the HELOC converts to a loan with a 20-year amortization period, but also include HELOCs that allow interest-only payments beyond the revolving period. (b) The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty. HELOCs beyond the revolving period and HELOANs have higher delinquency rates than HELOCs within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available for HELOCs within the revolving period. The higher delinquency rates associated with amortizing HELOCs and HELOANs are factored into the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. Impaired loans The table below sets forth information about the Firm’s residential real estate impaired loans, excluding PCI loans. These loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in a TDR. All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K.

The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. At June 30, 2019, Chapter 7 residential real estate loans included approximately 12% of residential mortgages and 8% of home equity that were 30 days or more past due. (b) At June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, $2.6 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, of loans modified subsequent to repurchase from Ginnie Mae in accordance with the standards of the appropriate government agency (i.e., FHA, VA, RHS) are not included in the table above. When such loans perform subsequent to modification in accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines, they are generally sold back into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform become subject to foreclosure. (c) Predominantly all impaired loans in the table above are in the U.S. (d) Represents the contractual amount of principal owed at June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018. The unpaid principal balance differs from the impaired loan balances due to various factors including charge-offs, net deferred loan fees or costs, and unamortized discounts or premiums on purchased loans. (e) At both June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, nonaccrual loans included $2.0 billion of TDRs for which the borrowers were less than 90 days past due. For additional information about loans modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual status refer to the Loan accounting framework in Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. 127 The following tables present average impaired loans and the related interest income reported by the Firm.

Loan modifications Modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, have been modified in TDRs. The following table presents new TDRs reported by the Firm. Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, (in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Residential mortgage $ 62 $ 100 $ 131 $ 247 Home equity 48 83 114 186 Total residential real estate – excluding PCI $ 110 $ 183 $ 245 $ 433 128 Nature and extent of modifications The U.S. Treasury’s Making Home Affordable programs, as well as the Firm’s proprietary modification programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and deferral of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement. The following tables provide information about how residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, were modified under the Firm’s loss mitigation programs described above during the periods presented. These tables exclude Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt.

The sum of the percentages exceeds 100% because predominantly all of the modifications include more than one type of concession. Concessions offered on trial modifications are generally consistent with those granted on permanent modifications. (b) Includes variable interest rate to fixed interest rate modifications and forbearances that meet the definition of a TDR for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. Forbearances suspend or reduce monthly payments for a specific period of time to address a temporary hardship. 129 Financial effects of modifications and redefaults The following tables provide information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, under the loss mitigation programs described above and about redefaults of certain loans modified in TDRs for the periods presented. The following tables present only the financial effects of permanent modifications and does not include temporary concessions offered through trial modifications. These tables also exclude Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt.

The dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it is probable that the loan will ultimately be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the last 12 months may not be representative of ultimate redefault levels. At June 30, 2019, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, permanently modified in TDRs were 9 years for both residential mortgage and home equity. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations). Active and suspended foreclosure At June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, the Firm had non-PCI residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of $609 million and $653 million, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure. 130 Other consumer loans The table below provides information for other consumer retained loan classes, including auto and business banking loans.

(b) The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at June 30, 2019. (c) For risk-rated business banking and auto loans, the primary credit quality indicator is the risk rating of the loan, including whether the loans are considered to be criticized and/or nonaccrual. 131 Other consumer impaired loans and loan modifications The table below sets forth information about the Firm’s other consumer impaired loans, including risk-rated business banking and auto loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status, and loans that have been modified in TDRs.

This typically occurs when the impaired loans have been partially charged off and/or there have been interest payments received and applied to the loan balance. (b) Predominantly all other consumer impaired loans are in the U.S. (c) Other consumer average impaired loans were $244 million and $277 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $245 million and $287 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The related interest income on impaired loans, including those on a cash basis, was not material for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. (d) Represents the contractual amount of principal owed at June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018. The unpaid principal balance differs from the impaired loan balances due to various factors, including charge-offs, interest payments received and applied to the principal balance, net deferred loan fees or costs, and unamortized discounts or premiums on purchased loans. Loan modifications Certain other consumer loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. All of these TDRs are reported as impaired loans. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for further information on other consumer loans modified in TDRs. At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, other consumer loans modified in TDRs were $72 million and $79 million, respectively. The impact of these modifications, as well as new TDRs, were not material to the Firm for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. Additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose loans have been modified in TDRs as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were not material. TDRs on nonaccrual status were $50 million and $57 million at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. 132 Purchased credit-impaired loans For a detailed discussion of PCI loans, including the related accounting policies, refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K.

(b) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. These property values do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should be viewed as estimates. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. (c) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis. (d) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at June 30, 2019. 133 Approximately 26% of the PCI home equity portfolio are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien HELOANs or HELOCs. The following table represents the Firm’s delinquency statistics for PCI junior lien home equity loans and lines of credit based on the unpaid principal balance as of June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018.

Substantially all HELOCs are beyond the revolving period. (b) Includes loans modified into fixed rate amortizing loans. The table below presents the accretable yield activity for the Firm’s PCI consumer loans for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, and represents the Firm’s estimate of gross interest income expected to be earned over the remaining life of the PCI loan portfolios.

(b) There were no impaired loans without an allowance. (c) Predominantly all impaired credit card loans are in the U.S. The following table presents average balances of impaired credit card loans and interest income recognized on those loans. Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, (in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Average impaired credit card loans $ 1,367 $ 1,244 $ 1,353 $ 1,234 Interest income on impaired credit card loans 18 16 35 31 Loan modifications The Firm may offer one of a number of loan modification programs to credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Most of the credit card loans have been modified under long-term programs for borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties. These modifications involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60 months, and typically include reducing the interest rate on the credit card. Substantially all modifications are considered to be TDRs. New enrollments in these loan modification programs were $226 million and $202 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $475 million and $425 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For all periods disclosed, new enrollments were less than 1% of total retained credit card loans. For additional information about credit card loan modifications, refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Financial effects of modifications and redefaults The following table provides information about the financial effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented. (in millions, except weighted-average data) Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Weighted-average interest rate of loans – before TDR 19.38% 18.00% 19.25% 17.61% Weighted-average interest rate of loans – after TDR 4.71 5.06 4.88 5.13 Loans that redefaulted within one year of modification(a) $ 32 $ 25 $ 66 $ 51 (a) Represents loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification. The amounts presented represent the balance of such loans as of the end of the quarter in which they defaulted. For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses two consecutive contractual payments. A substantial portion of these loans are expected to be charged-off in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off policy. Based on historical experience, the estimated weighted-average default rate for modified credit card loans was expected to be 34.04% and 33.38% as of June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. 135 Wholesale loan portfolio Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the risk rating assigned to each loan. For further information on these risk ratings, refer to Note 12 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K.

This typically occurs when the impaired loans have been partially charged-off and/or there have been interest payments received and applied to the loan balance. (b) Represents the contractual amount of principal owed at June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018. The unpaid principal balance differs from the impaired loan balances due to various factors, including charge-offs; interest payments received and applied to the carrying value; net deferred loan fees or costs; and unamortized discount or premiums on purchased loans. (c) Based upon the domicile of the borrower, largely consists of loans in the U.S. The following table presents the Firm’s average impaired retained loans for the periods indicated.

The retained interests in commercial and other securitizations trusts consisted of $1.2 billion of investment-grade retained interests at both June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, and $593 million and $623 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. 140 Residential mortgage The Firm securitizes residential mortgage loans originated by CCB, as well as residential mortgage loans purchased from third parties by either CCB or CIB. For a more detailed description of the Firm’s involvement with residential mortgage securitizations, refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Refer to the table on page 141 of this Note for more information on the consolidated residential mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated residential mortgage securitizations. Commercial mortgages and other consumer securitizations CIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by securitization trusts. For a more detailed description of the Firm’s involvement with commercial mortgage and other consumer securitizations, refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Refer to the table on page 141 of this Note for more information on the consolidated commercial mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizations. Re-securitizations For a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase’s participation in certain re-securitization transactions, refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. The following table presents the principal amount of securities transferred to re-securitization VIEs. Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, (in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Transfers of securities to VIEs Agency $ 2,564 $ 3,995 $ 7,067 $ 8,781 The following table presents information on nonconsolidated re-securitization VIEs. Nonconsolidated re-securitization VIEs (in millions) June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Firm-sponsored private-label Assets held in VIEs with continuing involvement(a) $ 22 $ 118 Interest in VIEs — 10 Agency Interest in VIEs 2,192 3,058 (a) Represents the principal amount and includes the notional amount of interest-only securities. As of June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, the Firm did not consolidate any agency re-securitization VIEs or any Firm-sponsored private-label re-securitization VIEs. Multi-seller conduits For a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase’s principal involvement with Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $8.2 billion and $20.1 billion of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm- administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were $8.4 billion and $8.0 billion at June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively, and are reported as off- balance sheet lending-related commitments in other unfunded commitments to extend credit. For more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments, refer to Note 22. Municipal bond vehicles Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond investments at short-term rates. TOB transactions are known as customer TOB trusts and non-customer TOB trusts. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party, refer to pages 141–142 of this Note for further information. The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB transactions. For a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase’s Municipal bond vehicles, refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. 141 Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities The following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by the Firm as of June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018. Assets Liabilities June 30, 2019 (in millions) Trading assets Loans Other(b) Total assets(c) Beneficial interests in VIE assets(d) Other(e) Total liabilities VIE program type Firm-sponsored credit card trusts $ — $ 28,230 $ 412 $ 28,642 $ 9,302 $ 8 $ 9,310 Firm-administered multi-seller conduits 3 22,575 335 22,913 14,734 36 14,770 Municipal bond vehicles 1,304 — 3 1,307 1,281 2 1,283 Mortgage securitization entities(a) 2 3,078 55 3,135 267 146 413 Other 113 — 182 295 1 99 100 Total $ 1,422 $ 53,883 $ 987 $ 56,292 $ 25,585 $ 291 $ 25,876 Assets Liabilities December 31, 2018 (in millions) Trading assets Loans Other(b) Total assets(c) Beneficial interests in VIE assets(d) Other(e) Total liabilities VIE program type Firm-sponsored credit card trusts $ — $ 31,760 $ 491 $ 32,251 $ 13,404 $ 12 $ 13,416 Firm-administered multi-seller conduits — 24,411 300 24,711 4,842 33 4,875 Municipal bond vehicles 1,779 — 4 1,783 1,685 3 1,688 Mortgage securitization entities(a) 53 3,285 40 3,378 308 161 469 Other 134 — 178 312 2 103 105 Total $ 1,966 $ 59,456 $ 1,013 $ 62,435 $ 20,241 $ 312 $ 20,553 (a) Includes residential and commercial mortgage securitizations. (b) Includes assets classified as cash and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets. (c) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. The assets and liabilities include third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation. (d) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled, “Beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest entities.” The holders of these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. For conduits program-wide credit enhancements, refer to note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $9.6 billion and $13.7 billion at June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018. (e) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. VIEs sponsored by third parties The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s- length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that construct, own and operate affordable housing, wind, solar and other alternative energy projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $16.0 billion and $16.5 billion, of which $4.1 billion and $4.0 billion was unfunded at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. In order to reduce the risk of loss, the Firm assesses each project and withholds varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. For further information on affordable housing tax credits, refer to Note 24 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. For more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments, refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q. Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may provide various services to Customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain Customer TOB transactions, the 142 Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate Customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to Customer TOB trusts at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was $5.3 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, was $8.6 billion and $7.7 billion, respectively. For more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments, refer to Note 22. Loan securitizations The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, and commercial mortgage. For a further description of the Firm’s accounting policies regarding securitizations, refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Securitization activity The following table provides information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization.

(d) The prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. (e) Includes prime mortgages only. Excludes loan securitization transactions entered into with Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. (f) Includes commercial mortgage and other consumer loans. Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to U.S. government-sponsored enterprises (“U.S. GSEs”). These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. Refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications. Refer to Note 14 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale of certain excess MSRs. 143 The following table summarizes the activities related to loans sold to the U.S. GSEs, and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines. Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, (in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Carrying value of loans sold $ 23,138 $ 8,076 $ 38,317 $ 16,836 Proceeds received from loan sales as cash 2 — 70 — Proceeds from loan sales as securities(a)(b) 22,823 7,959 37,660 16,578 Total proceeds received from loan sales(c) $ 22,825 $ 7,959 $ 37,730 $ 16,578 Gains on loan sales(d)(e) $ 104 $ 9 $ 153 $ 23 (a) Includes securities from U.S. GSEs and Ginnie Mae that are generally sold shortly after receipt or retained as part of the Firm’s Investment securities portfolio. (b) Included in level 2 assets. (c) Excludes the value of MSRs retained upon the sale of loans. (d) Gains on loan sales include the value of MSRs. (e) The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the proceeds received upon loan sale. Options to repurchase delinquent loans In addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain loans due to material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 22, the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding liability. For additional information, refer to Note 11. The following table presents loans the Firm repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans recognized on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. Substantially all of these loans and real estate are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. (in millions) Jun 30, 2019 Dec 31, 2018 Loans repurchased or option to repurchase(a) $ 5,214 $ 7,021 Real estate owned 56 75 Foreclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans(b) 277 361 (a) Predominantly all of these amounts relate to loans that have been repurchased from Ginnie Mae loan pools. (b) Relates to voluntary repurchases of loans, which are included in accrued interest and accounts receivable. Loan delinquencies and liquidation losses The table below includes information about components of nonconsolidated securitized financial assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and delinquencies as of June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018. Net liquidation losses(a) Securitized assets 90 days past due Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, (in millions) Jun 30, 2019 Dec 31, 2018 Jun 30, 2019 Dec 31, 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Securitized loans Residential mortgage: Prime / Alt-A & option ARMs $ 49,625 $ 50,679 $ 2,900 $ 3,354 $ 171 $ 168 $ 328 $ 271 Subprime 14,441 15,434 2,076 2,478 167 140 311 (462) Commercial and other 80,511 79,387 131 225 24 21 165 48 Total loans securitized $ 144,577 $ 145,500 $ 5,107 $ 6,057 $ 362 $ 329 $ 804 $ (143) (a) Includes liquidation gains as a result of private label mortgage settlement payments during the first quarter of 2018, which were reflected as asset recoveries by trustees. 144 Note 14 – Goodwill and Mortgage servicing rights For a discussion of the accounting policies related to goodwill and mortgage servicing rights, refer to Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Goodwill The following table presents goodwill attributed to the business segments. (in millions) June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Consumer & Community Banking $ 30,991 $ 30,984 Corporate & Investment Bank 6,769 6,770 Commercial Banking 2,860 2,860 Asset & Wealth Management 6,857 6,857 Total goodwill $ 47,477 $ 47,471 The following table presents changes in the carrying amount of goodwill. Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, (in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Balance at beginning of period $ 47,474 $ 47,499 $ 47,471 $ 47,507 Changes during the period from: Other(a) 3 (11) 6 (19) Balance at June 30, $ 47,477 $ 47,488 $ 47,477 $ 47,488 (a) Primarily relates to foreign currency remeasurement. Goodwill impairment testing For a further description of the Firm’s goodwill impairment testing, including the primary method used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units, and the assumptions used in the goodwill impairment test, refer to Impairment testing on pages 252–253 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. The Firm reviewed current economic conditions, estimated market cost of equity, as well as actual and projections of business performance for all its businesses. Based upon such reviews, the Firm concluded that the goodwill allocated to its reporting units was not impaired as of June 30, 2019 or December 31, 2018, nor was goodwill written off due to impairment during the six months ended June 30, 2019 or 2018. Declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s reporting units or their associated goodwill to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill. 145 Mortgage servicing rights MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. For a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs, refer to Notes 2 and 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. The following table summarizes MSR activity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. As of or for the three months ended June 30, As of or for the six months ended June 30, (in millions, except where otherwise noted) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Fair value at beginning of period $ 5,957 $ 6,202 $ 6,130 $ 6,030 MSR activity: Originations of MSRs 424 157 756 333 Purchase of MSRs 2 79 106 146 Disposition of MSRs(a) (217) (104) (328) (399) Net additions/(dispositions) 209 132 534 80 Changes due to collection/realization of expected cash flows (247) (187) (446) (347) Changes in valuation due to inputs and assumptions: Changes due to market interest rates and other(b) (540) 103 (841) 485 Changes in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions: Projected cash flows (e.g., cost to service) (350) (e) — (350) (e) — Discount rates 153 — 153 24 Prepayment model changes and other(c) (89) (9) (87) (31) Total changes in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions (286) (9) (284) (7) Total changes in valuation due to inputs and assumptions (826) 94 (1,125) 478 Fair value at June 30, $ 5,093 $ 6,241 $ 5,093 $ 6,241 Change in unrealized gains/(losses) included in income related to MSRs held at June 30, $ (826) $ 94 $ (1,125) $ 478 Contractual service fees, late fees and other ancillary fees included in income 437 446 857 911 Third-party mortgage loans serviced at June 30, (in billions) 527 534 527 534 Servicer advances, net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts, at June 30, (in billions)(d) 2.2 3.3 2.2 3.3 (a) Includes excess MSRs transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage backed securities (“SMBS”). In each transaction, a portion of the SMBS was acquired by third parties at the transaction date; the Firm acquired the remaining balance of those SMBS as trading securities. (b) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and expected prepayments. (c) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates. (d) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance), which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements. (e) The decrease in projected cash flows was largely related to default servicing assumption updates. 146 The following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including the impact of MSR risk management activities) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, (in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 CCB mortgage fees and related income Net production revenue $ 353 $ 93 $ 553 $ 188 Net mortgage servicing revenue: Operating revenue: Loan servicing revenue 417 441 821 954 Changes in MSR asset fair value due to collection/realization of expected cash flows (247) (187) (446) (347) Total operating revenue 170 254 375 607 Risk management: Changes in MSR asset fair value due to market interest rates and other(a) (540) 104 (841) 486 Other changes in MSR asset fair value due to other inputs and assumptions in model(b) (286) (9) (284) (7) Change in derivative fair value and other 582 (118) 872 (485) Total risk management (244) (23) (253) (6) Total net mortgage servicing revenue (74) 231 122 601 Total CCB mortgage fees and related income 279 324 675 789 All other — — — — Mortgage fees and related income $ 279 $ 324 $ 675 $ 789 (a) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and expected prepayments. (b) Represents the aggregate impact of changes in model inputs and assumptions such as projected cash flows (e.g., cost to service), discount rates and changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates (e.g., changes in prepayments due to changes in home prices). The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, and outlines hypothetical sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below. (in millions, except rates) Jun 30, 2019 Dec 31, 2018 Weighted-average prepayment speed assumption (constant prepayment rate) 11.58% 8.78% Impact on fair value of 10% adverse change $ (216) $ (205) Impact on fair value of 20% adverse change (414) (397) Weighted-average option adjusted spread(a)(b) 7.84% 7.87% Impact on fair value of a 100 basis point adverse change $ (183) $ (235) Impact on fair value of a 200 basis point adverse change (353) (452) (a) Includes the impact of operational risk and regulatory capital. (b) The prior period amount has been revised to conform with the current period presentation. Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be linear. In this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change. 147 Note 15 – Deposits For further information on deposits, refer to Note 17 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. At June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, noninterest- bearing and interest-bearing deposits were as follows. (in millions) June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 U.S. offices Noninterest-bearing (included $26,673 and $17,204 at fair value)(a)(b) $ 394,237 $ 386,709 Interest-bearing (included $2,530 and $2,487 at fair value)(a)(b) 841,397 813,881 Total deposits in U.S. offices 1,235,634 1,200,590 Non-U.S. offices Noninterest-bearing (included $2,445 and $2,367 at fair value)(a)(b) 20,419 21,459 Interest-bearing (included $1,276 and $1,159 at fair value)(a)(b) 268,308 248,617 Total deposits in non-U.S. offices 288,727 270,076 Total deposits $ 1,524,361 $ 1,470,666 (a) Includes structured notes classified as deposits for which the fair value option has been elected. For a further discussion, refer to Note 3 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. (b) In the second quarter of 2019, the Firm reclassified balances related to certain structured notes from interest-bearing to noninterest- bearing deposits as the associated returns are recorded in principal transactions revenue and not in net interest income. This change was applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised to conform with the current presentation. Note 16 – Leases Lease commitments Effective January 1, 2019, the Firm adopted new guidance that requires lessees to recognize on the Consolidated balance sheets all leases with lease terms greater than twelve months as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset. Accordingly, the Firm recognized operating lease liabilities and ROU assets of $8.2 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively. The adoption of the new lease guidance did not have a material impact on the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income. The change in accounting due to the adoption of the new lease guidance did not result in a material change to the future net minimum rental payments/receivables or to the net rental expense when compared to December 31, 2018. Firm as lessee At June 30, 2019, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries were obligated under a number of noncancelable leases, predominantly operating leases for premises and equipment used primarily for business purposes. These leases generally have terms of 20 years or less, determined based on the contractual maturity of the lease, and include periods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease when the Firm is reasonably certain that it will exercise those options. None of these lease agreements impose restrictions on the Firm’s ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity financing transactions or enter into further lease agreements. Certain of these leases contain escalation clauses that will increase rental payments based on maintenance, utility and tax increases, which are non-lease components. The Firm elected not to separate lease and non-lease components of a contract for its real estate leases. As such, real estate lease payments represent payments on both lease and non-lease components. Operating lease liabilities and ROU assets are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The future lease payments are discounted at a rate that represents the Firm’s collateralized borrowing rate for financing instruments of a similar term and are included in accounts payable and other liabilities. The operating lease ROU asset, included in premises and equipment, also includes any lease prepayments made, plus initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received. Rental expense associated with operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and generally included in occupancy expense in the Consolidated statements of income. 148 The following tables provide information related to the Firm’s operating leases: As of June 30, (in millions, except where otherwise noted) 2019 Right-of-use assets $ 8,118 Lease liabilities 8,404 Weighted average remaining lease term (in years) 8.7 Weighted average discount rate 3.75% Supplemental cash flow information Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities - operating cash flows $ 778 Supplemental non-cash information Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations $ 587 (in millions) Three months ended June 30, 2019 Six months ended June 30, 2019 Rental expense Gross rental expense $ 506 $ 1,020 Sublease rental income (42) (88) Net rental expense $ 464 $ 932 The following table presents future payments under operating leases as of June 30, 2019: Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2019 (excluding six months ended June 30, 2019) $ 787 2020 1,535 2021 1,356 2022 1,161 2023 988 After 2023 4,180 Total future minimum lease payments 10,007 Less: Imputed interest (1,603) Total $ 8,404 In addition to the table above, as of June 30, 2019, the Firm had additional future operating lease commitments of $1.5 billion that were signed but had not yet commenced. These operating leases will commence between 2019 and 2022 with lease terms up to 25 years. Firm as lessor The Firm provides auto and equipment lease financing to its customers through lease arrangements with lease terms that may contain renewal, termination and/or purchase options. Generally, the Firm’s lease financings are operating leases. These assets are recognized in other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term to reduce the asset to its estimated residual value. Depreciation expense is included in technology, communications and equipment expense in the Consolidated statements of income. The Firm’s lease income is generally recognized on a straight- line basis over the lease term and is included in other income in the Consolidated statements of income. On a periodic basis, the Firm assesses leased assets for impairment, and if the carrying amount of the leased asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows from the lease payments and the estimated residual value upon disposition of the leased asset, an impairment loss is recognized. The risk of loss on auto and equipment leased assets relating to the residual value of the leased assets is monitored through projections of the asset residual values at lease origination and periodic review of residual values, and is mitigated through arrangements with certain manufacturers or lessees. The following table presents the carrying value of assets subject to leases reported on the Consolidated balance sheets: (in millions) June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Carrying value of assets subject to operating leases, net of accumulated depreciation $ 22,406 $ 21,428 Accumulated depreciation 5,643 5,303 The following table presents the Firm’s operating lease income and the related depreciation expense on the Consolidated statements of income: Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, (in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Operating lease income $ 1,327 $ 1,112 $ 2,643 $ 2,159 Depreciation expense 988 852 1,985 1,663 The following table presents future receipts under operating leases as of June 30, 2019: Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2019 (excluding six months ended June 30, 2019) $ 2,107 2020 3,381 2021 1,866 2022 386 2023 69 After 2023 136 Total future minimum lease payments $ 7,945 149 Note 17 - Preferred stock For a further discussion on preferred stock, refer to Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K.

Note 21 – Regulatory capital For a detailed discussion on regulatory capital, refer to Note 26 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s insured depository institutions (“IDI”), including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Effective January 1, 2019, the capital adequacy of the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries is evaluated against the fully phased- in measures under Basel III and represents the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches. During 2018, the required capital measures were subject to the transitional rules and as of December 31, 2018 were the same on a fully phased-in and on a transitional basis. Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1, Tier 1, Total, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to these capital requirements by their respective primary regulators. The following table represents the minimum and well- capitalized ratios to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were subject as of June 30, 2019. Minimum capital ratios Well-capitalized ratios BHC(a)(e)(f) IDI(b)(e)(f) BHC(c) IDI(d) Capital ratios CET1 10.5% 7.0% N/A 6.5% Tier 1 12.0 8.5 6.0 8.0 Total 14.0 10.5 10.0 10.0 Tier 1 leverage 4.0 4.0 N/A 5.0 SLR 5.0 6.0 N/A 6.0 Note: The table above is as defined by the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC and to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries are subject. (a) Represents the minimum capital ratios applicable to the Firm under Basel III. The CET1 minimum capital ratio includes a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% and GSIB surcharge of 3.5%. (b) Represents requirements for JPMorgan Chase’s IDI subsidiaries. The CET1 minimum capital ratio includes a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% that is applicable to the IDI subsidiaries. The IDI subsidiaries are not subject to the GSIB surcharge. (c) Represents requirements for bank holding companies pursuant to regulations issued by the Federal Reserve. (d) Represents requirements for IDI subsidiaries pursuant to regulations issued under the FDIC Improvement Act. (e) For the period ended December 31, 2018, the CET1, Tier 1, Total and Tier 1 leverage minimum capital ratios applicable to the Firm were 9.0%, 10.5%, 12.5%, and 4.0% and the CET1, Tier 1, Total and Tier 1 leverage minimum capital ratios applicable to the Firm’s IDI subsidiaries were 6.375%, 7.875%, 9.875%, and 4.0%, respectively. (f) Represents minimum SLR requirement of 3.0%, as well as, supplementary leverage buffers of 2.0% and 3.0% for BHC and IDI, respectively. 154 The following tables present the risk-based and leverage-based capital metrics for JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. under both the Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced Approaches. As of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were well-capitalized and met all capital requirements to which each was subject.

The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees are refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expire without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. For a further discussion of lending- related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm’s related accounting policies, refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. To provide for probable credit losses inherent in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018. The amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower. 156 Off–balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments Contractual amount Carrying value(g) June 30, 2019 Dec 31, 2018 Jun 30, 2019 Dec 31, 2018 By remaining maturity (in millions) Expires in 1 year or less Expires after 1 year through 3 years Expires after 3 years through 5 years Expires after 5 years Total Total Lending-related Consumer, excluding credit card: Home equity $ 549 $ 1,202 $ 2,185 $ 17,263 $ 21,199 $ 20,901 $ 12 $ 12 Residential mortgage(a) 9,477 — — 12 9,489 5,481 — — Auto 7,694 962 95 45 8,796 8,011 2 2 Consumer & Business Banking 10,503 679 104 721 12,007 11,673 19 19 Total consumer, excluding credit card 28,223 2,843 2,384 18,041 51,491 46,066 33 33 Credit card 633,970 — — — 633,970 605,379 — — Total consumer(b) 662,193 2,843 2,384 18,041 685,461 651,445 33 33 Wholesale: Other unfunded commitments to extend credit(c) 61,732 129,593 159,234 8,223 358,782 351,490 883 852 Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees(c) 14,658 10,552 4,776 2,210 32,196 33,498 554 521 Other letters of credit(c) 3,066 220 37 — 3,323 2,825 3 3 Total wholesale(b) 79,456 140,365 164,047 10,433 394,301 387,813 1,440 1,376 Total lending-related $ 741,649 $ 143,208 $ 166,431 $ 28,474 $ 1,079,762 $1,039,258 $ 1,473 $ 1,409 Other guarantees and commitments Securities lending indemnification agreements and guarantees(d) $ 203,868 $ — $ — $ — $ 203,868 $ 186,077 $ — $ — Derivatives qualifying as guarantees 1,594 135 12,394 40,509 54,632 55,271 228 367 Unsettled resale and securities borrowed agreements 113,218 875 71 — 114,164 102,008 — — Unsettled repurchase and securities loaned agreements 122,806 — — — 122,806 57,732 — — Loan sale and securitization-related indemnifications: Mortgage repurchase liability NA NA NA NA NA NA 89 89 Loans sold with recourse NA NA NA NA 1,031 1,019 27 30 Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments(e) 164,784 — — — 164,784 58,960 — — Other guarantees and commitments(f) 4,505 2,931 1,537 2,749 11,722 8,183 (79) (73) (a) Includes certain commitments to purchase loans from correspondents.

In regulatory filings with the Federal Reserve these commitments are shown gross of risk participations. (d) At June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, collateral held by the Firm in support of securities lending indemnification agreements was $214.6 billion and $195.6 billion, respectively. Securities lending collateral primarily consists of cash and securities issued by governments that are members of the G7 and U.S. government agencies. (e) At June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, includes guarantees to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation under the sponsored member repo program and commitments and guarantees associated with the Firm’s membership in certain clearing houses. (f) At June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, primarily includes letters of credit hedged by derivative transactions and managed on a market risk basis, and unfunded commitments related to institutional lending. Additionally, includes unfunded commitments predominantly related to certain tax-oriented equity investments. (g) For lending-related products, the carrying value represents the allowance for lending-related commitments and the guarantee liability; for derivative- related products, the carrying value represents the fair value. 157 Other unfunded commitments to extend credit Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally consist of commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit. Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade and similar transactions. The following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018.

Derivatives qualifying as guarantees The Firm transacts certain derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. For further information on these derivatives, refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. The following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying as guarantees as of June 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018.

For a further discussion of credit derivatives, refer to Note 4. Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications In connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with GSEs the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such representations and warranties are breached by the Firm. Further, although the Firm’s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, the Firm does provide recourse servicing in certain limited cases where it agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans. For additional information, refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. The liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. For additional information regarding litigation, refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q and Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. 158 Sponsored member repo program In 2018 the Firm commenced the sponsored member repo program, wherein the Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment and performance of its sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under the FICC’s rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these overnight guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the cash or high-quality securities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house therefore the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into consideration the associated collateral, is included in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line on page 156. For additional information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of collateral pledged under repurchase agreements, refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Guarantees of subsidiaries The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company. These guarantees, which rank on a parity with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 156 of this Note. For additional information, refer to Note 19 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Note 23 – Pledged assets and collateral For a discussion of the Firm’s pledged assets and collateral, refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Pledged assets The Firm may pledge financial assets that it owns to maintain potential borrowing capacity at discount windows with Federal Reserve banks, various other central banks and FHLBs. Additionally, pledged assets are used for other purposes, including to collateralize repurchase and other securities financing agreements, to cover short sales and to collateralize derivative contracts and deposits. Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or repledged or otherwise used by the secured parties and are parenthetically identified on the Consolidated balance sheets as assets pledged. The following table presents the Firm’s pledged assets. (in billions) June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Assets that may be sold or repledged or otherwise used by secured parties $ 155.0 $ 104.0 Assets that may not be sold or repledged or otherwise used by secured parties 93.6 83.7 Assets pledged at Federal Reserve banks and FHLBs 490.2 475.3 Total assets pledged $ 738.8 $ 663.0 Total assets pledged do not include assets of consolidated VIEs; these assets are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. Refer to Note 13 for additional information on assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs. For additional information on the Firm’s securities financing activities, refer to Note 10. For additional information on the Firm’s long-term debt, refer to Note 19 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Collateral The Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that it is permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use. This collateral is generally obtained under resale and other securities financing agreements, prime brokerage-related held-for-investment customer receivables and derivative contracts. Collateral is generally used under repurchase and other securities financing agreements, to cover short sales and to collateralize derivative contracts and deposits. The following table presents the fair value of collateral accepted. (in billions) June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Collateral permitted to be sold or repledged, delivered, or otherwise used $ 1,319.2 $ 1,245.3 Collateral sold, repledged, delivered or otherwise used 1,033.9 998.3 159 Note 24 – Litigation Contingencies As of June 30, 2019, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants, putative defendants or respondents in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations and regulatory/government investigations. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to approximately $1.3 billion at June 30, 2019. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: • the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages, • the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, • the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and • the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. FX- related investigations and inquiries by government authorities, including competition authorities, are ongoing, and the Firm is cooperating with and working to resolve those matters. In May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. In January 2017, the Firm was sentenced, with judgment entered thereafter and a term of probation ending in January 2020. The Department of Labor has granted the Firm a five-year exemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) until January 2023. The Firm will need to reapply in due course for a further exemption to cover the remainder of the ten-year disqualification period. In addition, the Firm has agreed to pay fines totaling $265 million in connection with the settlement of FX- related investigations conducted by the European Commission and the Swiss Competition Commission which were announced in May 2019 and June 2019, respectively. Separately, in February 2017 the South Africa Competition Commission referred its FX investigation of the Firm and other banks to the South Africa Competition Tribunal, which is conducting civil proceedings concerning that matter. In August 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures. Certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, and certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm and a number of other foreign exchange dealers in November 2018 (the “opt-out action”). The two FX-related actions brought by participants or beneficiaries of qualified ERISA plans have been dismissed. Putative class actions on behalf of consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates (the “consumer action”) and purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments (the “indirect purchaser action”) remain pending in the District Court. In addition, some FX related individual and putative class actions have been filed outside the U.S. General Motors Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. participated in, and was the Administrative Agent on behalf of a syndicate of lenders on, a $1.5 billion syndicated Term Loan facility (“Term Loan”) for General Motors Corporation (“GM”). In July 2009, in connection with the GM bankruptcy 160 proceedings, the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Motors Liquidation Company (“Creditors Committee”) filed a lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., in its individual capacity and as Administrative Agent for other lenders on the Term Loan, seeking to hold the underlying lien invalid based on the filing of a UCC-3 termination statement relating to the Term Loan. In January 2015, following several court proceedings, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the Bankruptcy Court’s dismissal of the Creditors Committee’s claim and remanded the case to the Bankruptcy Court with instructions to enter partial summary judgment for the Creditors Committee as to the termination statement. The proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court thereafter continued with respect to, among other things, additional defenses asserted by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the value of additional collateral on the Term Loan that was unaffected by the filing of the termination statement at issue. In addition, certain Term Loan lenders filed cross-claims in the Bankruptcy Court against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. seeking indemnification and asserting various claims. In April 2019, the parties finalized a settlement agreement to fully resolve the litigation, and the Bankruptcy Court approved that settlement in June 2019. In July 2019, the Bankruptcy Court issued orders dismissing with prejudice all claims filed against the Firm, including the cross-claims that were brought by certain Term Loan lenders. Interchange Litigation. A group of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted respective rules in violation of antitrust laws. The parties settled the cases for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card interchange, and modifications to certain credit card network rules. In December 2013, the District Court granted final approval of the settlement. A number of merchants appealed the settlement to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which, in June 2016, vacated the District Court’s certification of the class action and reversed the approval of the class settlement. In March 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court declined petitions seeking review of the decision of the Court of Appeals. The case was remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with the appellate decision. The original class action was divided into two separate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties to the class action seeking monetary relief finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement, and the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking preliminary approval of the modified settlement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants have collectively contributed an additional $900 million to the approximately $5.3 billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In January 2019, the amended agreement was preliminarily approved by the District Court, and formal notice of the class settlement is proceeding in accordance with the District Court’s order. The class action seeking primarily injunctive relief continues separately. In addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks, and those actions are proceeding. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has received subpoenas and requests for documents and, in some cases, interviews, from federal and state agencies and entities, including the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and various state attorneys general, as well as the European Commission (“EC”), the Swiss Competition Commission (“ComCo”) and other regulatory authorities and banking associations around the world relating primarily to the process by which interest rates were submitted to the British Bankers Association (“BBA”) in connection with the setting of the BBA’s London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies, principally in 2007 and 2008. Some of the inquiries also relate to similar processes by which information on rates was submitted to the European Banking Federation (“EBF”) in connection with the setting of the EBF’s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Firm continues to cooperate with these investigations to the extent that they are ongoing. ComCo’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and other banks are subject, continues. In December 2016, the EC issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with the European General Court, and that appeal is pending. In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in a series of individual and putative class actions related to benchmarks, including U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA and, in a separate consolidated putative class action, during the period that it was administered by ICE Benchmark Administration. These actions have been filed, or consolidated for pre-trial purposes, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In these actions, plaintiffs make varying allegations that in various periods, starting in 2000 or later, defendants either individually or collectively manipulated various benchmark rates by submitting rates that were artificially low or high. Plaintiffs allege that they transacted in loans, derivatives or other financial instruments whose values are affected by changes in these rates and assert a variety of claims including antitrust claims seeking treble damages. These actions are in various stages of litigation. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the District Court dismissed certain claims, including antitrust claims brought by some plaintiffs whom the District Court found did not have 161 standing to assert such claims, and permitted certain claims to proceed, including antitrust, Commodity Exchange Act, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and common law claims. The plaintiffs whose antitrust claims were dismissed for lack of standing have filed an appeal. The District Court granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants and denied class certification motions filed by other plaintiffs. The Firm has agreed to settle putative class actions related to Swiss franc LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate, the Singapore Swap Offer Rate and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate, as well as certain of the putative class actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR. The District Court declined to grant preliminary approval to the settlement involving the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate after concluding that plaintiffs lacked standing and dismissing the litigation. The remaining settlements are all subject to further documentation and court approval. The Firm has also settled the putative class action related to EURIBOR, and the Court has granted final approval of that settlement. Metals Investigations and Litigation. Various authorities, including the Department of Justice’s Criminal Division, are conducting investigations relating to trading practices in the metals markets and related conduct. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with these investigations. Several putative class action complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Firm and certain current and former employees, alleging a precious metals futures and options price manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust enrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the General Business Law of the State of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class actions in February 2019. The Firm is also a defendant in a consolidated action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging monopolization of silver futures in violation of the Sherman Act. Wendel. Since 2012, the French criminal authorities have been investigating a series of transactions entered into by senior managers of Wendel Investissement (“Wendel”) during the period from 2004 through 2007 to restructure their shareholdings in Wendel. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Paris branch provided financing for the transactions to a number of managers of Wendel in 2007. JPMorgan Chase has cooperated with the investigation. The investigating judges issued an ordonnance de renvoi in November 2016, referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel for alleged complicity in tax fraud. No date for trial has been set by the court. In January 2018, the Paris Court of Appeal issued a decision cancelling the mise en examen of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. In September 2018, the Court of Cassation, France’s highest court, ruled that a mise en examen is a prerequisite for an ordonnance de renvoi and remanded the case to the Court of Appeal. In June 2019, the Court of Appeal declined to annul the ordonnance de renvoi referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel, and the Firm has reapplied to the Court of Cassation for a determination as to whether the Court of Appeal’s decision is consistent with the Court of Cassation’s September 2018 ruling. Any further actions in the criminal proceedings are stayed pending the outcome of that application. In addition, a number of the managers have commenced civil proceedings against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The claims are separate, involve different allegations and are at various stages of proceedings. * * * In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upwards or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm’s legal expense/(benefit) was $69 million and $0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $(12) million and $70 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will 162 not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period. 163 Note 25 – Business segments The Firm is managed on a line of business basis. There are four major reportable business segments - Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. For a further discussion concerning JPMorgan Chase’s business segments, refer to Segment results below, and Note 31 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Segment results The following tables provide a summary of the Firm’s segment results as of or for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax- exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. For additional information on the Firm’s managed basis, refer to Note 31 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Business segment capital allocation The amount of capital assigned to each business is referred to as equity. On at least an annual basis, the assumptions and methodologies used in capital allocation are assessed and as a result, the capital allocated to lines of business may change. For additional information on business segment capital allocation, refer to Line of business equity on page 91 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K.

Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of the Firm as of December 31, 2018, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 26, 2019, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet information as of December 31, 2018, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. Basis for Review Results These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Firm’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. August 5, 2019 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 300 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10017 166 JPMorgan Chase & Co.

These changes were made to align the accounting treatment between the balance sheet and the related interest income or expense, primarily by offsetting interest income and expense for certain prime brokerage-related held-for- investment customer receivables and payables that are currently presented as a single margin account on the balance sheet. In addition, the Firm reclassified balances related to certain instruments and structured notes from interest-earning/bearing to noninterest-earning/bearing assets and liabilities as the associated returns are recorded in principal transactions revenue and not in net interest income. These changes were applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised to conform with the current presentation.

An instrument containing such terms or features is referred to as a “hybrid.” The component of the hybrid that is the non-derivative instrument is referred to as the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt instrument (i.e., the host) and an embedded option that allows the issuer to redeem the debt issue at a specified date for a specified amount (i.e., the embedded derivative). However, a floating rate instrument is not a hybrid composed of a fixed-rate instrument and an interest rate swap. ERISA: Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 EPS: Earnings per share Exchange-traded derivatives: Derivative contracts that are executed on an exchange and settled via a central clearing house. Fannie Mae: Federal National Mortgage Association FASB: Financial Accounting Standards Board 169 FCA: Financial Conduct Authority FDIC: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Federal Reserve: The Board of the Governors of the Federal Reserve System FFIEC: Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council FHA: Federal Housing Administration FHLB: Federal Home Loan Bank FICO score: A measure of consumer credit risk based on information in consumer credit reports produced by Fair Isaac Corporation. Because certain aged data is excluded from credit reports based on rules in the Fair Credit Reporting Act, FICO scores may not reflect all historical information about a consumer. Firm: JPMorgan Chase & Co. Forward points: represents the interest rate differential between two currencies, which is either added to or subtracted from the current exchange rate (i.e., “spot rate”) to determine the forward exchange rate. Freddie Mac: Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Free-standing derivatives: is a derivative contract entered into either separate and apart from any of the Firm’s other financial instruments or equity transactions. Or, in conjunction with some other transaction and is legally detachable and separately exercisable. FTE: Fully taxable-equivalent FVA: Funding valuation adjustment FX: Foreign exchange G7: “Group of Seven nations”: Countries in the G7 are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S. G7 government securities: Securities issued by the government of one of the G7 nations. Ginnie Mae: Government National Mortgage Association GSE: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac GSIB: Global systemically important banks HELOAN: Home equity loan HELOC: Home equity line of credit Home equity – senior lien: represents loans and commitments where JPMorgan Chase holds the first security interest on the property. Home equity – junior lien: represents loans and commitments where JPMorgan Chase holds a security interest that is subordinate in rank to other liens. HQLA: High-quality liquid assets HTM: Held-to-maturity IDI: Insured depository institutions IHC: JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC, an intermediate holding company Impaired loan: Impaired loans are loans measured at amortized cost, for which it is probable that the Firm will be unable to collect all amounts due, including principal and interest, according to the contractual terms of the agreement. Impaired loans include the following: • All wholesale nonaccrual loans • All TDRs (both wholesale and consumer), including ones that have returned to accrual status IPO: Initial public offering Investment-grade: An indication of credit quality based on JPMorgan Chase’s internal risk assessment system. “Investment grade” generally represents a risk profile similar to a rating of a “BBB-”/“Baa3” or better, as defined by independent rating agencies. IR: Interest rate ISDA: International Swaps and Derivatives Association JPMorgan Chase: JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.: JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association J.P. Morgan Securities: J.P. Morgan Securities LLC LCR: Liquidity coverage ratio LGD: Loss given default LIBOR: London Interbank Offered Rate LLC: Limited Liability Company LOB: Line of business Loss emergence period: represents the time period between the date at which the loss is estimated to have been incurred and the ultimate realization of that loss. LTV: “Loan-to-value ratio”: For residential real estate loans, the relationship, expressed as a percentage, between the principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of the collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the loan. Origination date LTV ratio The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan. Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the origination date. Current estimated LTV ratio An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. As a result, the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates. Combined LTV ratio The LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien home equity products. Managed basis: A non-GAAP presentation of Firmwide financial results that includes reclassifications to present revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Management also uses this financial measure at the segment level, because it believes this provides information to enable investors to understand the underlying operational 170 performance and trends of the particular business segment and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with the performance of competitors. Master netting agreement: A single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due). Measurement alternative: Measures equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. MBS: Mortgage-backed securities MD&A: Management’s discussion and analysis Moody’s: Moody’s Investor Services Mortgage product types: Alt-A Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than subprime loans but have characteristics that would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income. Option ARMs The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable- rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers. Prime Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records who meet specific underwriting requirements, including prescriptive requirements related to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and generally have reliable payment histories. Subprime Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were offered to certain customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan. MSA: Metropolitan statistical areas MSR: Mortgage servicing rights NA: Data is not applicable or available for the period presented. Net Capital Rule: Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Net charge-off/(recovery) rate: represents net charge-offs/ (recoveries) (annualized) divided by average retained loans for the reporting period. Net interchange income includes the following components: • Interchange income: Fees earned by credit and debit card issuers on sales transactions. • Rewards costs: The cost to the Firm for points earned by cardholders enrolled in credit card rewards programs. • Partner payments: Payments to co-brand credit card partners based on the cost of loyalty program rewards earned by cardholders on credit card transactions. Net yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all sources of funds. NM: Not meaningful Nonaccrual loans: Loans for which interest income is not recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. Collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status. Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and certain assets acquired in loan satisfactions, predominantly real estate owned and other commercial and personal property. OCC: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCI: Other comprehensive income/(loss) OPEB: Other postretirement employee benefit OTC: “Over-the-counter derivatives”: Derivative contracts that are negotiated, executed and settled bilaterally between two derivative counterparties, where one or both counterparties is a derivatives dealer. OTC cleared: “Over-the-counter cleared derivatives”: Derivative contracts that are negotiated and executed bilaterally, but subsequently settled via a central clearing 171 house, such that each derivative counterparty is only exposed to the default of that clearing house. OTTI: Other-than-temporary impairment Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of total net revenue. Parent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co. Participating securities: represents unvested share-based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees under its share-based compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities, based on their respective rights to receive dividends. PCI: “Purchased credit-impaired” loans represents certain loans that were acquired and deemed to be credit-impaired on the acquisition date in accordance with the guidance of the FASB. The guidance allows purchasers to aggregate credit-impaired loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter into one or more pools, provided that the loans have common risk characteristics (e.g., product type, LTV ratios, FICO scores, past due status, geographic location). A pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. PD: Probability of default PRA: Prudential Regulation Authority Pre-provision profit/(loss): represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses. Principal transactions revenue: Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the price at which the Firm is willing to buy a financial or other instrument and the price at which the Firm is willing to sell that instrument. It also consists of realized (as a result of closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments) and unrealized (as a result of changes in valuation) gains and losses on financial and other instruments (including those accounted for under the fair value option) primarily used in client-driven market-making activities and on private equity investments. In connection with its client-driven market- making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities (including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk- management activities, including: (a) certain derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives. PSU(s): Performance share units Receivables from customers: primarily represents prime brokerage-related held-for-investment customer receivables from brokerage customers that are collateralized through assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts, as such no allowance is held against these receivables. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. Regulatory VaR: Daily aggregated VaR calculated in accordance with regulatory rules. REO: Real estate owned Reported basis: Financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP, which excludes the impact of taxable-equivalent adjustments. Retained loans: Loans that are held-for-investment (i.e. excludes loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value). Revenue wallet: Total fee revenue based on estimates of investment banking fees generated across the industry (i.e., the revenue wallet) from investment banking transactions in M&A, equity and debt underwriting, and loan syndications. Source: Dealogic, a third-party provider of investment banking competitive analysis and volume based league tables for the above noted industry products. RHS: Rural Housing Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture ROE: Return on equity ROTCE: Return on tangible common equity ROU assets: Right-of-use assets RSU(s): Restricted stock units RWA: “Risk-weighted assets”: Basel III establishes two comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (a Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which include capital requirements for credit risk, market risk, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, also operational risk. Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk- weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced. S&P: Standard and Poors SAR(s): Stock appreciation rights SEC: U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Seed capital: Initial JPMorgan capital invested in products, such as mutual funds, with the intention of ensuring the fund is of sufficient size to represent a viable offering to clients, enabling pricing of its shares, and allowing the manager to develop a track record. After these goals are 172 achieved, the intent is to remove the Firm’s capital from the investment. Single-name: Single reference-entities SLR: Supplementary leverage ratio SMBS: Stripped mortgage-backed securities SPEs: Special purpose entities Structural interest rate risk: represents interest rate risk of the non-trading assets and liabilities of the Firm. Structured notes: Structured notes are financial instruments whose cash flows are linked to the movement in one or more indexes, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodities prices, prepayment rates, or other market variables. The notes typically contain embedded (but not separable or detachable) derivatives. Contractual cash flows for principal, interest, or both can vary in amount and timing throughout the life of the note based on non-traditional indexes or non-traditional uses of traditional interest rates or indexes. Suspended foreclosures: Loans referred to foreclosure where formal foreclosure proceedings have started but are currently on hold, which could be due to bankruptcy or loss mitigation. Includes both judicial and non-judicial states. Taxable-equivalent basis: In presenting managed results, the total net revenue for each of the business segments and the Firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax- exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities; the corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. TBVPS: Tangible book value per share TCE: Tangible common equity TDR: “Troubled debt restructuring” is deemed to occur when the Firm modifies the original terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty.

U.S. GSEs include Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but do not include Ginnie Mae, which is directly owned by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. U.S. GSE obligations are not explicitly guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. U.S. Treasury: U.S. Department of the Treasury VA: U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs VaR: “Value-at-risk” is a measure of the dollar amount of potential loss from adverse market moves in an ordinary market environment.

Retail: clients include financial intermediaries and individual investors. Asset Management has two high-level measures of its overall fund performance: Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds rated 4- or 5-star: Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on their risk-adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. The “overall Morningstar rating” is derived from a weighted average of the performance associated with a fund’s three-, five- and ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S. domiciled funds, separate star ratings are given at the individual share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not rated and 175 hence excluded from this analysis. All ratings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive this analysis are sourced from these fund rating providers. The data providers re-denominate the asset values into U.S. dollars. This % of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for U.S. domiciled funds, and at a “primary share class” level to represent the star rating of all other funds except for Japan where Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The “primary share class”, as defined by Morningstar, denotes the share class recommended as being the best proxy for the portfolio and in most cases will be the most retail version (based upon annual management charge, minimum investment, currency and other factors). The performance data could have been different if all funds/ accounts would have been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three, and five years): All quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive this analysis are sourced from the fund ranking providers. Quartile rankings are done on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. The data providers re-denominate the asset values into U.S. dollars. This % of AUM is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S. domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to represent the quartile ranking of the U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The “primary share class”, as defined by Morningstar, denotes the share class recommended as being the best proxy for the portfolio and in most cases will be the most retail version (based upon annual management charge, minimum investment, currency and other factors). Where peer group rankings given for a fund are in more than one “primary share class” territory both rankings are included to reflect local market competitiveness (applies to “Offshore Territories” and “HK SFC Authorized” funds only). The performance data could have been different if all funds/ accounts would have been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results. 176 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. For a discussion of the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, refer to the Market Risk Management section of Management’s discussion and analysis and pages 124–131 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Firm’s management, including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the Certification statements issued by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, in a firm as large and complex as JPMorgan Chase, lapses or deficiencies in internal controls do occur from time to time, and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls in the future. For further information, refer to “Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” on page 148 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. There was no change in the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three months ended June 30, 2019, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting.
