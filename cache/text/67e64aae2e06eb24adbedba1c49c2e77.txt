News Release 2 In the discussion below of results of JPMorgan Chase as a Firm and of its business segments, information is presented on a managed basis. For more information about managed basis, as well as other non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures used by management to evaluate the performance of each line of business, see page 5. Comparisons noted in the sections below are calculated for the first quarter of 2017 versus the prior-year first quarter, unless otherwise specified. JPMORGAN CHASE (JPM) Net revenue on a reported basis totaled $24.7 billion, $23.4 billion, and $23.2 billion for the first quarter of 2017, fourth quarter of 2016, and first quarter of 2016, respectively.

Net revenue was $25.6 billion, up 6%. Net interest income was $12.4 billion, up 6%, primarily driven by loan growth and the net impact of higher rates. Noninterest revenue was $13.2 billion, up 6%, primarily driven by the Corporate & Investment Bank, largely offset by Card new account origination costs and lower MSR risk management results. Noninterest expense was $15.0 billion, up 9%, primarily driven by higher compensation and legal expense, auto lease depreciation, and FDIC-related expense, as well as a contribution to the Firm's Foundation. The provision for credit losses was $1.3 billion, down from $1.8 billion, due to net reserve releases in the Wholesale portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the Consumer provision. The Wholesale net reserve releases were $93 million in the current quarter, primarily driven by Oil & Gas, versus reserve increases of $713 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase in the Consumer provision included a write-down of the Student loan portfolio, and higher Card net charge-offs, which were in line with expectations. First-quarter results included a tax benefit of $373 million related to the appreciation of the Firm’s stock price upon vesting of employee stock-based awards above their original grant price.

Net revenue was $11.0 billion, down 1%. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 3 Consumer & Business Banking net revenue was $4.9 billion, up 8%, reflecting strong deposit growth. Mortgage Banking net revenue was $1.5 billion, down 18%, driven by lower net servicing revenue reflecting lower MSR risk management results, as well as servicing portfolio run-off. Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto net revenue was $4.5 billion, down 3%, driven by Card new account origination costs, predominantly offset by higher net interest income on higher loan balances and higher auto lease volumes. Noninterest expense was $6.4 billion, up 5%, primarily driven by higher auto lease depreciation and business growth. The provision for credit losses was $1.4 billion, an increase of $380 million, driven by a write-down of the Student loan portfolio, which was transferred to held-for-sale, and higher Card net charge-offs, which were in line with expectations.

Net revenue was $9.5 billion, up 17%, compared with a weak prior-year quarter. Banking revenue was $3.0 billion, up 25%. Investment Banking revenue was $1.7 billion, up 34%, with higher debt and equity underwriting fees reflecting strong underlying issuance activity and share gains, partially offset by lower advisory fees. The business continued to rank #1 in Global Investment Banking fees. Treasury Services revenue was $981 million, up 11%, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and growth in operating deposits. Lending revenue was $389 million, up 29%, reflecting higher gains on securities received from restructurings, and lower mark-to-market losses on hedges. Markets & Investor Services revenue was $6.5 billion, up 14%, largely driven by higher Markets revenue, up 13%. Fixed Income Markets revenue, up 17%, reflected robust performance in Securitized Products on strong demand and spread tightening. Rates improved, with increased market activity, particularly in Europe in advance of upcoming elections and in reaction to central bank actions. Revenue from Credit Products also increased, driven by the higher market levels. Equity Markets revenue was up 2%, with strength in prime services and corporate derivatives. Securities Services revenue was $916 million, up 4%. Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $222 million, largely driven by valuation adjustments, compared with a loss of $336 million in the prior-year quarter. Noninterest expense was $5.1 billion, up 7%, largely driven by higher performance-based compensation expense. The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $96 million, compared to an expense of $459 million in the prior-year quarter, which included reserve builds in the Oil & Gas and Metals & Mining portfolios.

News Release 6 2. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures: Notes on non-GAAP financial measures a. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm’s results, including the overhead ratio, and the results of the lines of business, on a “managed” basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These non-GAAP financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, see page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. b. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation of common stockholders’ equity to TCE, see page 9 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are meaningful to the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. c. Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted expense excludes Firmwide legal expense (an expense of $218 million in the first quarter of 2017). The adjusted overhead ratio measures the Firm’s adjusted expense as a percentage of managed net revenue. Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of these items on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance. Notes on key performance measures d. Core loans represent loans considered central to the Firm’s ongoing businesses; core loans exclude loans classified as trading assets, runoff portfolios, discontinued portfolios and portfolios the Firm has an intent to exit. e. Estimated as of March 31, 2017. The Basel III supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”), which becomes effective for the Firm on January 1, 2018, and the Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In Common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital and CET1 ratio, which become effective for the Firm on January 1, 2019, are each considered key regulatory capital measures. These measures are used by management, bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Firm’s capital position. For additional information on these measures, see Capital Risk Management on pages 76-85 of the Firm’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 7 Additional notes: 3. Last twelve months (“LTM”). 4. Net of employee issuance. 5. Effective the first quarter of 2017, the Firm revised its method for allocating LOB equity, which includes no longer allocating for goodwill and other intangible assets. For further information, see pages 76-85 of the 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 6. Excludes Commercial Card. 7. High quality liquid assets (“HQLA”) represents the estimated amount of assets that qualify for inclusion in the liquidity coverage ratio. 8. The amount of credit provided to clients represents new and renewed credit, including loans and commitments. The amount of credit provided to small businesses reflects loans and increased lines of credit provided by Consumer & Business Banking; Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto; and Commercial Banking. The amount of credit provided to nonprofit and U.S. and non- U.S. government entities, including U.S. states, municipalities, hospitals and universities, represents credit provided by the Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking.
