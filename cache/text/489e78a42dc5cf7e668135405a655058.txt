For the quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share was $5.98, up 21% from the previous quarter and up 629% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $6.12, up 19% from the previous quarter and up 461% from a year ago. &ldquo;The next industrial revolution has begun &mdash; companies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center &mdash; AI factories &mdash; to produce a new commodity: artificial intelligence,&rdquo; said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. &ldquo;AI will bring significant productivity gains to nearly every industry and help companies be more cost- and energy-efficient, while expanding revenue opportunities. &ldquo;Our data center growth was fueled by strong and accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference on the Hopper platform. Beyond cloud service providers, generative AI has expanded to consumer internet companies, and enterprise, sovereign AI, automotive and healthcare customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets. &ldquo;We are poised for our next wave of growth. The Blackwell platform is in full production and forms the foundation for trillion-parameter-scale generative AI. Spectrum-X opens a brand-new market for us to bring large-scale AI to Ethernet-only data centers. And NVIDIA NIM is our new software offering that delivers enterprise-grade, optimized generative AI to run on CUDA everywhere &mdash; from the cloud to on-prem data centers and RTX AI PCs &mdash; through our expansive network of ecosystem partners.&rdquo; NVIDIA also announced a ten-for-one forward stock split of NVIDIA&rsquo;s issued common stock to make stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors. The split will be effected through an amendment to NVIDIA&rsquo;s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which will result in a proportionate increase in the number of shares of authorized common stock. Each record holder of common stock as of the close of market on Thursday, June 6, 2024, will receive nine additional shares of common stock, to be distributed after the close of market on Friday, June 7, 2024. Trading is expected to commence on a split-adjusted basis at market open on Monday, June 10, 2024. NVIDIA is increasing its quarterly cash dividend by 150% from $0.04 per share to $0.10 per share of common stock. The increased dividend is equivalent to $0.01 per share on a post-split basis and will be paid on Friday, June 28, 2024, to all shareholders of record on Tuesday, June 11, 2024.

CFO Commentary Commentary on the quarter by Colette Kress, NVIDIA&rsquo;s executive vice president and chief financial officer, is available at https://investor.nvidia.com . Conference Call and Webcast Information NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its first quarter fiscal 2025 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA&rsquo;s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com . The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA&rsquo;s conference call to discuss its financial results for its second quarter of fiscal 2025. Non-GAAP Measures To supplement NVIDIA&rsquo;s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA&rsquo;s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user&rsquo;s overall understanding of the company&rsquo;s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company&rsquo;s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company&rsquo;s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company&rsquo;s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. &nbsp;
