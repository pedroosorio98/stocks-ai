And for the first time, the Firm led the nation in total U.S. deposits, as consumers and businesses continue to view us as their partner of choice.” Dimon added: “In Consumer & Community Banking, card sales and merchant processing volumes were once again up double digits, while loans and deposits continued to grow strongly. In the Corporate & Investment Bank, we continued to lead our peers in Investment Banking fees, and Treasury Services and Securities Services each generated over $1 billion in revenue. Commercial Banking again delivered outstanding performance with record revenue as our long-term investments in the business are paying off. Our Asset & Wealth Management business delivered strong results with record net income and AUM this quarter.” Dimon concluded: “The global economy continues to do well and the U.S. consumer remains healthy with solid wage growth. Unfortunately, natural disasters in the U.S. and abroad have impacted many of our customers and we have responded with enormous financial support as well as the expertise and generosity of our employees to help these customers, clients and communities. Building on our success to-date in Detroit, we have announced new initiatives in Chicago and Washington, D.C. to drive inclusive economic growth in those communities. We will be there to do our part. And this is in addition to the $1.7 trillion of credit and capital supplied this year to consumers and small and mid-sized businesses and corporate clients.” FORTRESS PRINCIPLES Book value per share of $66.95, up 5%; tangible book value per share2 of $54.03, up 5% Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital2 of $187 billion and ratio2 of 12.5% Firm SLR2 of 6.6% OPERATING LEVERAGE 3Q17 reported expense of $14.3 billion; reported overhead ratio of 57%; 3Q17 adjusted expense2 of $14.4 billion; adjusted overhead ratio2 of 55% CAPITAL RETURN $6.5 billion4 returned to shareholders in 3Q17 $4.5 billion of net repurchases and common dividend of $0.56 per share SUPPORTED CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES & COMMUNITIES $1.7 trillion of credit and capital6 raised YTD $197 billion of credit for consumers $17 billion of credit for U.S. small businesses $601 billion of credit for corporations $820 billion of capital raised for corporate clients and non-U.S. government entities $65 billion of credit and capital raised for nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 2 In the discussion below of Firmwide results of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), information is presented on a managed basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The discussion below of the Firm's business segments is also presented on a managed basis. For more information about managed basis, and non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures used by management to evaluate the performance of each line of business, see page 5.

Net revenue was $26.2 billion, up 3%. Net interest income was $13.1 billion, up 10%, primarily driven by the net impact of rising rates and loan growth, partially offset by declines in Markets net interest income. Noninterest revenue was $13.1 billion, down 4%, driven by lower Markets revenue. Noninterest expense was $14.3 billion, down 1%. The prior year included two items totaling $175 million in Consumer & Community Banking. The provision for credit losses was $1.5 billion, up from $1.3 billion in the prior year. The increase reflected a net reserve build of $303 million in the Consumer portfolio, driven by Card, and higher net charge-offs of $148 million, partially offset by a net reserve release of $116 million in the Wholesale portfolio, primarily driven by Energy7 and Commercial Real Estate. The prior year included a net reserve build in the Consumer portfolio of $226 million and a net reserve release in the Wholesale portfolio of $76 million, primarily driven by Energy7.

Net revenue was $12.0 billion, up 6%. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 3 Consumer & Business Banking net revenue was $5.4 billion, up 15%, predominantly driven by higher deposit margins and strong deposit growth. Mortgage Banking net revenue was $1.6 billion, down 17%, largely driven by lower net servicing revenue, loan spread compression, and lower production margins. Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto net revenue was $5.1 billion, up 7%, predominantly driven by higher auto lease volumes and net interest income on higher Card loan balances, partially offset by higher Card new account origination costs. Noninterest expense was $6.5 billion, flat compared with the prior year. The prior year included two items totaling $175 million related to liabilities from a merchant in bankruptcy and mortgage servicing reserves. Excluding these two items, noninterest expense would have been up 3%, predominantly driven by higher auto lease depreciation and business growth, partially offset by lower marketing expense. The provision for credit losses was $1.5 billion, an increase of $223 million, driven by higher net charge-offs, due to Card but partially offset by Mortgage, and a higher reserve build in Card. Net charge-offs included $63 million of incremental charge- offs reported in accordance with regulatory guidance8, predominantly in Auto.

Treasury Services revenue was $1.1 billion, up 15%, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and growth in operating deposits. Lending revenue was $331 million, up 17%, reflecting lower mark-to-market losses on hedges. Markets & Investor Services revenue was $5.5 billion, down 16%, driven by lower Markets revenue, down 21%. Fixed Income Markets revenue was down 27%, as lower revenue across all products was driven by sustained low volatility and tighter credit spreads, against a very strong prior year. Equity Markets revenue was down 4% compared to a strong prior year, reflecting lower revenue in derivatives predominantly offset by strength in Prime Services and Cash Equities. Securities Services revenue was $1.0 billion, up 10%, driven by higher interest rates and deposit growth, as well as higher asset-based fees driven by improving market conditions.

Notes on non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures: Notes on non-GAAP financial measures a. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, see page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. b. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, see page 9 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $66.95, $66.05 and $63.79 at September 30, 2017, June 30, 2017, and September 30, 2016, respectively. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are meaningful to the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. c. Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted expense excluded Firmwide legal expense/(benefit) of $(107) million, $61 million and $(71) million for the three months ended September 30, 2017, June 30, 2017, and September 30, 2016, respectively. The adjusted overhead ratio measures the Firm’s adjusted expense as a percentage of adjusted managed net revenue. Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of these items on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance. Notes on key performance measures d. Estimated as of September 30, 2017. The Basel III supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”), to which the Firm will be subject on January 1, 2018, and Basel III Fully Phased-In capital, risk-weighted assets and capital ratios, to which the Firm will be subject on January 1, 2019, are all considered key regulatory capital measures. The capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the Basel III approach (Standardized or Advanced) that results, for each quarter, in the lower ratio (the “Collins Floor”). These measures are used by management, bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Firm’s capital position. For additional information on these measures, including the Collins Floor, see Capital Risk Management on pages 76-85 of the Firm’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and pages 42-48 of the Firm's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2017. e. Core loans represent loans considered central to the Firm’s ongoing businesses; core loans exclude loans classified as trading assets, runoff portfolios, discontinued portfolios and portfolios the Firm has an intent to exit. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 6 Additional notes: 3. Last twelve months (“LTM”). 4. Net of stock issued to employees. 5. Excludes Commercial Card. 6. The amount of credit provided to clients represents new and renewed credit, including loans and commitments. The amount of credit provided to small businesses reflects loans and increased lines of credit provided by Consumer & Business Banking; Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto; and Commercial Banking. The amount of credit provided to nonprofit and U.S. and non- U.S. government entities, including U.S. states, municipalities, hospitals and universities, represents credit provided by the Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking. 7. Energy includes Oil & Gas, Natural Gas Pipelines, and Metals & Mining. 8. The Firm reported $63 million of net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2017, in accordance with regulatory guidance regarding the timing of loss recognition for certain auto and residential real estate loans in bankruptcy and auto loans where assets were acquired in loan satisfaction. 9. The legal benefit in the second quarter of 2017 related to a settlement with the FDIC receivership for Washington Mutual and with Deutsche Bank as trustee to certain Washington Mutual trusts, and was recognized in noninterest revenue in Corporate.
