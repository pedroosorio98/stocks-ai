(NYSE: JPM) today reported net income for the third quarter of 2014 of $5.6 billion, compared with a net loss of $0.4 billion in the third quarter of 2013. Earnings per share were $1.36, compared with $(0.17) in the third quarter of 2013. Revenue1 for the quarter was $25.2 billion, up 5% compared with the prior year. The Firm’s return on tangible common equity1 for the third quarter of 2014 was 13%. Core loans1 increased by 7% compared with the prior year. The Firm repurchased $1.5 billion of common equity4 in the third quarter. Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the financial results: “Our businesses continue to perform well. Consumer & Community Banking deposit growth led the nation as the FDIC reported Chase #1 in deposit growth for the third consecutive year. Our Card business delivered double-digit sales volume growth and Mortgage Banking continues to reposition the business and manage through cyclical- lows. The Corporate & Investment Bank saw strong performance in fees, maintaining a #1 position in Global IB fees year to date, with particular strength in equity capital markets. In Markets, we saw increased activity and better performance overall, particularly in currencies and emerging markets. In Commercial Banking, strong competition in the industry for quality assets resulted in some spread compression. However, our Commercial Banking clients leveraged the services of our investment bank, generating record investment banking revenues year to date, and growth in Commercial Real Estate remains strong. Lastly, Asset Management saw its twenty- second consecutive quarter of long-term inflows, record net income and strong margins.” Dimon continued: “While challenges remain in the global economic recovery, the U.S. economy is an exception, showing signs of steady improvement. Corporate America is in good shape with strong balance sheets and employment trends continue to be positive. JPMorgan continued to support the economic recovery. We provided credit and raised capital1 of $1.6 trillion for our clients during the first nine months of 2014, which included $15 billion for U.S. small businesses." Dimon concluded: “Despite challenges, we have continued to deliver strong underlying performance, maintain our fortress balance sheet and liquidity, simplify the business and adapt to regulatory changes. We remain very focused on executing the control agenda and investing to protect our customers and the company for the future.” In the discussion below of the business segments and of JPMorgan Chase as a Firm, information is presented on a managed basis.

Other Corporate reported net income of $357 million, compared with a net loss of $6.5 billion in the prior year. The current quarter included $512 million (pretax) of legal expense, compared with approximately $9.2 billion (pretax) of legal expense in the prior year. The current quarter also included approximately $400 million of net income benefit from tax adjustments.

See notes on page 12 for further explanation of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis totaled $24.2 billion, $24.5 billion, and $23.1 billion for the third quarter of 2014, second quarter of 2014, and third quarter of 2013, respectively. Discussion of Results: Net income was $5.6 billion, compared with a loss of $380 million in the prior year. The increase was driven by lower noninterest expense and higher net revenue, partially offset by higher provision for credit losses. Net revenue was $25.2 billion, up $1.3 billion, or 5%, compared with the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $13.8 billion, up $875 million, or 7%, compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $11.4 billion, up $404 million, or 4%, compared with the prior year, reflecting lower interest expense and higher investment securities yields, partially offset by lower loan yields. The provision for credit losses was an expense of $757 million, compared with a benefit of $543 million in the prior year. The total consumer provision for credit losses was an expense of $897 million, compared with a benefit of $273 million in the prior year. The current-quarter consumer provision reflected a $200 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses, compared to a $1.6 billion reduction in the prior year. The current- JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 11 quarter consumer allowance release primarily reflects the continued improvement in home prices and delinquency trends in the residential real estate portfolio and the run-off of the student loan portfolio. Consumer net charge-offs were $1.1 billion, compared with $1.3 billion in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 1.19% and 1.47%, respectively. The wholesale provision for credit losses was a benefit of $140 million, compared with a benefit of $270 million in the prior year. Wholesale net charge-offs were $17 million, compared with $26 million in the prior year, resulting in net charge-rates of 0.02% and 0.03%, respectively. The Firm’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained1 was 1.63%, compared with 1.89% in the prior year. The Firm’s allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans retained1 was 155%, compared with 140% in the prior year. The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $8.4 billion, down from the prior quarter and prior year levels of $9.0 billion and $10.4 billion, respectively. Noninterest expense was $15.8 billion, down $7.8 billion, or 33%, compared with the prior year, driven by lower legal expense. The current quarter noninterest expense included approximately $1.1 billion of legal expense, compared with approximately $9.3 billion of legal expense in the prior year. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 12 Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm's consolidated results and the results of the lines of business on a “managed” basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total consolidated net revenue for the Firm (and for each of the business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on consolidated net income/(loss) as reported by the Firm or on net income/(loss) as reported by the lines of business. b. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained, and the allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans retained, exclude the following: loans accounted for at fair value and loans held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans; and the allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans. Additionally, net charge-offs and net charge-off rates exclude the impact of PCI loans. c. Tangible common equity (“TCE”) and return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s earnings as a percentage of average TCE. TCE and ROTCE are meaningful to management, as well as analysts and investors, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity, as well as facilitating comparisons of the Firm with competitors. d. Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital and the CET1 ratio under the Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In rules, and the supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) under the U.S. final SLR rule, are each non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are used by management, bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Firm’s capital position. For additional information on these measures, see Regulatory capital on pages 161-165 of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, and on pages 74-78 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2014. e. The CIB provides non-GAAP financial measures, as such measures are used by management to assess the underlying performance of the business and for comparability with peers. • The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans excludes the impact of consolidated Firm- administered multi-seller conduits and trade finance loans, to provide a more meaningful assessment of CIB’s allowance coverage ratio. • Prior to January 1, 2014, the CIB provided non-GAAP financial measures excluding the impact of FVA (effective fourth quarter 2013) and DVA on net revenue and net income. Beginning in the first quarter 2014, the Firm does not exclude FVA and DVA from its assessment of business performance; however, the Firm continues to present these non-GAAP measures for the periods prior to January 1, 2014, as they reflected how management assessed the underlying business performance of the CIB in those prior periods. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 13 Additional notes on financial measures: a. Core loans include loans considered central to the Firm’s ongoing businesses; core loans exclude runoff portfolios, discontinued portfolios and portfolios the Firm has an intent to exit. b. The amount of credit provided to clients represents new and renewed credit, including loans and commitments. The amount of credit provided to small businesses reflects loans and increased lines of credit provided by Consumer & Business Banking; Card, Merchant Services & Auto; and Commercial Banking. The amount of credit provided to nonprofit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities, represents that provided by the Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking. c. Consumer & Community Banking 2014 allocated equity includes $3.0 billion of capital held at the Consumer & Community Banking level related to legacy mortgage servicing matters. d. The credit and debit volume metric is based on Nilson data as of 2013. e. Consumer & Business Banking deposit rankings are based on FDIC 2014 Summary of Deposits survey per SNL Financial. f. Credit card sales volume is presented excluding Commercial Card. Rankings and comparison of general purpose credit card sales volume are based on disclosures by peers and internal estimates. Rankings are as of the second quarter of 2014. g. Banking portal ranking is per compete.com, as of August 2014. h. Mortgage Banking provision for credit losses is included in Real Estate Portfolios, in production expense in Mortgage Production, and in core servicing expense in Mortgage Servicing. i. #1 credit card issuer ranking based on disclosures by peers and internal estimates as of 2Q14. j. #1 U.S. co-brand issuer based on Phoenix Credit Card Monitor for the 12-months period ending June 2014; based on card accounts and revolving balance dollars. k. Global Visa ranking based on Visa data as of 2Q14 based on consumer and business credit card sales volume. l. #1 wholly-owned merchant acquirer based on Nilson data as of 2013; share of U.S. eCommerce volume based on the Internet Retailer Top 500 for 2013 and JPMC internal merchant client data.

(d) Ratios are based upon annualized amounts. (e) Basel III Transitional rules became effective on January 1, 2014; all prior period data is based on Basel I rules. As of September 30, 2014, and June 30, 2014, the ratios presented are calculated under the Basel III Advanced Transitional Approach. See footnote (a) on page 33 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement for additional information on Basel III. CET1 capital under Basel III replaced Tier 1 common capital under Basel I. Prior to Basel III becoming effective on January 1, 2014, Tier 1 common capital under Basel I was a non-GAAP financial measure. For further discussion of Tier 1 common capital, see page 35 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. (f) The increase in average VaR during the three months ended June 30, 2014 was due to a change in the MSR hedge position in Mortgage Banking in advance of an anticipated update to certain MSR model assumptions. When such updates were implemented, VaR decreased to prior levels. The MSR model and assumptions are continuously evaluated and periodically updated to reflect recent market behavior. Mortgage Banking average VaR was $3 million, $20 million and $10 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014, June 30, 2014 and September 30, 2013, respectively, and $9 million and $15 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. For information regarding CIB VaR, see Corporate and Investment Bank on page 21 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. (g) Included unsecured long-term debt of $204.7 billion, $205.6 billion and $199.2 billion for the periods ended September 30, 2014, June 30, 2014 and September 30, 2013, respectively. (h) Estimated. (i) On May 20, 2014, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly common stock dividend from $0.38 to $0.40 per share. On May 21, 2013, the Board increased the quarterly common stock dividend from $0.30 to $0.38 per share.
